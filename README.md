## About the Campaign

**Star Wars: Forgotten Ones** plunges its protagonists ‚Äì individuals plucked from diverse eras of galactic history ‚Äì into the tumultuous **Rebellion Era**. Awakening aboard a derelict starship with fragmented memories, they are the "Forgotten Ones," living relics of bygone ages.

Their journey is one of discovery: uncovering the reasons for their preservation, navigating a galaxy transformed by Imperial rule and nascent rebellion, and confronting ancient conspiracies that intertwine with their lost pasts. Our campaign is heavily **narrative-focused**, emphasizing cooperative storytelling, character development, and unraveling deep mysteries, with combat taking a backseat to intrigue and interaction.
