The ship's klaxon screams in his ear, a frantic, rhythmic counterpoint to the steady, logical voice of his droid.\nThe choice is stark and immediate. The mounds of silver ingots promise a life of freedom, but each one is heavy, dense. Loading even a fraction of it would take hours he doesn't have. His eyes dart around the vault, then to his own empty cargo pockets on the envirosuit. He looks at GE-3, a utility droid with compartments designed for rocks and survey equipment, not a king's ransom.\nThe corridor back to the maintenance tubes is a black maw, promising escape but demanding he leave everything behind. The ship shudders again, more violently this time, and a fine shower of metallic dust rains down from the vault's ceiling. The fortune is here. Survival is there.

Dryzan’s boot finds a solid purchase on GE-3’s shoulder plating. The droid’s servos whine under the shifting weight, its internal gyroscopes fighting to maintain equilibrium. For a precarious second, the entire structure—man, droid, and desk—wobbles dangerously. Then, with a final, graceful push, Dryzan is up, one hand braced firmly against the freezing ceiling. Below him, GE-3’s manipulator arms clamp onto his leg like a vise, providing a surprisingly steady anchor. The droid’s whirring systems settle into a low, constant hum of effort.\n\nFrom his new perch, the Cargo Master’s office looks small and distant. The only things that matter are the panel above and the drop below. He can feel the micro-vibrations of GE-3’s balancing act traveling up through his leg.\n\nThe panel itself is even more formidable up close. It’s a thick slab of reinforced durasteel, secured not by simple bolts, but by four heavy-duty magnetic clamps, one at each corner. A recessed handle in the center suggests it's meant to be pulled straight down, but the clamps hold it fast. There is no visible manual override; the entire mechanism is electronic and, like everything else, utterly powerless.
