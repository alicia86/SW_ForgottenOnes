The eight hours of forced, dreamless sleep have been a balm. The leaden weight in their limbs is gone, replaced by a manageable ache, the phantom pains of muscles remembering how to live.\n\nMost remarkably, when they open their eyes, the darkness is gone. The soft, ambient light of the barracks is clear and steady. The blindness, the most terrifying aspect of their awakening, has passed, leaving behind only the memory of its suffocating presence.\n\nA new sensation, or rather the lack of one, slowly registers. The deep, resonant hum of the hyperdrive that has been the constant, underlying note of their existence since leaving the *Aether* is gone. The ship is no longer rushing through a river of light. It is adrift.\n\nA chime, soft and clear, echoes through the barracks\u0027 internal speakers, followed by Eve\u0027s calm, synthesized voice.",

He didn’t even bother removing his Beskar’gam as he could already feel the weariness begin to overcome him.  Besides, sleeping in his armor was second nature to Mandalorian’s.  Removing his helmet he let it fall unceremoniously to the floor by the bunk.   As he sat back on the bunk he asked Eve a question.   It was *the* question that had been on his mind since he had awoken in the Medbay.  \n\n\n**”Eve I’m guessing that you have some extensive data banks on the galaxy\u0027s history.   Hopefully over the last twenty years.”**  He laid back on to the bunk as his weariness grew more oppressive.  Eve had responded back with an affirmative to his question.    **”Good.   Please look for the name Marina Cloudspinner.   Jedi Padawan assigned to Master Silas Draay.  Find any info you can on her and send it to my bracer computer.  Thanks. He took a deep breath as his vision darkened and he felt the redoubled effects of the cryo sleep descend upon him.   He did his best to fall into a Force trance that would allow him to heal quicker.  His body once again felt tired and used as he laid there.  Sleep, if what was claiming him, hit him hard.   \n\n\nThe next thing he remembered was Eve’s voice telling him that they had arrived at the system and recharging operations had begun.  Opening his eyes he discovered that his vision had returned.   With a slow and stiff effort his muscles all protested being asked to function in such a mundane effort as sitting.    He wondered what would happen if he asked more of his body right now.  Despite the aches and pains of movement he stood and attempted to stretch some of the stiffness and painful discomfort away.",

Old dathomiri chants wind down her spine. Bringing forth in her dreams arcs of lighting. But as all things do they all fade to black and Varda slowly sits up. \n\nShe begins to gather pouches and sashes. Forming her outfit. She unties her hair letting it flow down to her back in rivers of silver. she grasps her cane letting the strange warmth of shadowed sunlight and static od a storm yet to brake mesh and move with her own presence. She sits letting the last vestige of sleep finally fade.  Then with a sigh and a weary smile to herself at letting gravity torture some more she stands with her bones creaking. coughing slightly as the dryness of her throat she startles as she realises she has missed too many cups of tea in her absence. She walks slowly enjoying the veiw of the ship and taking the time to look at the blazing sun. Following the lights of what she hopes is the kitchen she meanders her way through. \n\nReaching it she takes a moment to untie a certain knot in her bag and with a twitch of the force she floats out a menagerie of tea cups and a strange tea pot.",

Lare and carved from a dark wood. the outside full to the brim of small runes painted in a light purple. The final cup is circular made of a pale white no personality. just a pale white cup. The teapot itself is made of a crystal. Crudely shaped and but done with love. She sets each out filling the tea pot with water and sprinkling her own herbs inside. She sets the water to boil then takes a seat herself letting the sound of the flame bring her comfort.",

The ship\u0027s immense, wing-like solar collectors are visible, their dark surfaces drinking in the raw energy. Next to the viewport is a simple control panel, clearly designed to adjust the filtration levels, allowing one to dim the star\u0027s brilliant glare to a comfortable, ambient glow. It is a room designed for quiet contemplation as much as for sustenance.",

The emptiness of his stomach was unlike anything he had felt before.   \n\n\nThe movement of his body felt good.  Tired and weary muscles stretched and loosened with every step.  As he walked he thought once again about Nadia and the familiar sense he felt.   How she looked at his clan sigil almost as if she was in disbelief of her own eyes.   He still couldn’t place her face or name.  Not recognizing her face wasn’t a surprise.   Judging from her age she seemed to be late teens or early twenties.  If he had seen her before she would have still been a young child.   As for her name it didn’t ring a bell.",

He sits, placing his lightsaber in front of him and entering a crisscross position, balling his fists and setting them on an adjacent knee; it\u0027s a daily meditation technique used to engage his mind for routine warmups.\n\nOnce done, he exits the room and walks toward the galley to get breakfast. He nods at those within the galley before walking towards the paste dispenser, but does not think much of those in the galley. Walking to a dispenser, he fills a bowl, then moves towards an isolated table to eat.",

I don’t use Force magic.  It can’t be that.  We all slipped up and made a mistake, and it’s bad luck.  Maybe we got caught in an experiment of some kind.  Something swapped my dataries for gems and wiped all the data and starmaps I had. Pretty sure a Jedi didn’t ruin my life because of Force stuff.”**\n\nShe approached the table.  \n\n**“Also, if there is any more of that stuff, can I have some?  It smells delicious.”  **",

The oppressive, moving bubble of light is gone, replaced by a clean, continuous glow from the overhead panels. The ship no longer feels like a tomb; it feels like a silent, empty, waiting vessel.\n\nFollowing the schematic on her datapad, she makes her way through a series of identical, spartan corridors, past the empty barracks, and deeper into the ship\u0027s mid-section. The doors to the areas marked \u0027Storage\u0027 and \u0027Workshop\u0027 hiss open as she approaches.\n\nThe space inside is vast, a multi-level bay that likely serves as both the primary cargo hold and the main workshop. A heavy-duty lift platform sits dormant in the center, and the upper walls are lined with catwalks and sealed storage lockers, each marked with arcane, alphanumeric designations.\n\nUnlike the rest of the ship, which is almost clinically sterile, this area shows faint signs of having once been a place of active work. There are faded scuff marks on the deck plating where heavy equipment was once dragged. Workbenches are bolted to the walls, their surfaces wiped clean but bearing the faint scars and chemical stains of countless projects. Empty tool racks and powered-down fabrication units line one wall.\n\nIt feels like a space that was meticulously scrubbed and decommissioned. All the tools, all the projects, all the personal effects of the last crew to work here have been systematically and thoroughly removed. The only things left are the fixtures, the faint ghosts of past labor, and a profound sense of emptiness. It is a perfectly functional workshop, waiting for a new crew and a new purpose.",

Thinking of her home ship brought on a brief, intense pang of sadness. *What had happened to her, to lose everything?*\n\nIyola shook her head.  *No time for that, not now.* The workshop had a few large pieces of equipment that were vaguely intriguing, but what really piqued her interest was the row of lockers on the upper catwalk.   This ship had clearly been scrubbed, *but no one can catch everything. *\n\nIyola looked around for the best route to access the catwalk.  She could use her ascender, of course, but there might be a ladder. At the very least, a free climb here would be fun.",

A quick scan of the area reveals her options.\n\nThe main lift platform in the center of the bay is clearly the primary method for reaching the upper catwalks. Its controls, however, are dark and unresponsive, likely deactivated to conserve power or awaiting a primary systems reboot. \n\nAt the far end of the bay, a standard-issue maintenance ladder is bolted to the wall, leading directly up to the main catwalk level. The bay walls themselves are not sheer; they are a network of thick power conduits, structural support beams, and recessed maintenance panels, offering a challenging but feasible path for a skilled climber. Above, the heavy girders supporting the catwalks are exposed, providing numerous solid anchor points for her ascension cable.",

The air up here is still and silent. She approaches the first bank of storage lockers. They are simple, grey, utilitarian containers, each sealed with a basic electronic lock that is currently unpowered. A manual release latch allows her to open them.\n\nThe first locker is empty. The second, the third, the fourth—all empty, wiped clean, not even a speck of dust remaining. The scrub was professional, thorough, and disheartening. She moves to the very last locker in the row, tucked away in a corner where the main lights cast a deep shadow. She pops the latch.\n\nThis one, too, is empty. For a moment, she feels a pang of disappointment. But as she starts to close the door, a faint, metallic scraping sound catches her ear. Something small and heavy just rolled in the back.\n\nKneeling down, she peers into the dark recess. There, tucked into the far corner behind a support strut, is something the cleanup crew missed. It\u0027s a handheld device, about the size of a heavy-duty hydrospanner. It\u0027s made of a dull, non-reflective metal, heavy for its size, with an ergonomic grip on one end and a complex-looking, crystalline emitter on the other. A small, dark viewscreen and a single, multi-function dial are its only controls. It looks like some kind of highly specialized diagnostic or calibration tool, unremarkable enough to be easily overlooked. When she picks it up, she feels a faint, almost imperceptible hum vibrating from within it.",

In the center of the room, a holographic dejarik table sits dormant, its projector dark. Comfortable-looking lounge chairs are arranged in a conversational grouping in one corner. Along another wall, a series of what look like enclosed simulation pods are powered down, their access doors sealed.\n\nBut what truly dominates the space is the far wall. It is not metal, but a massive, floor-to-ceiling holoscreen, currently displaying a breathtaking, hyper-realistic, and deeply serene image: a dense, alien forest of impossibly tall, bioluminescent trees, their glowing canopies filtering a soft, purple twilight. The image is not static; there is a gentle, almost imperceptible sway to the trees, the slow drift of glowing spores in the air. The scene is utterly silent, but it radiates a profound sense of peace and tranquility.\n\nLike the workshop, the room has been scrubbed of any personal effects—no stray datapads, no half-finished games, no personal trinkets. It is a perfectly preserved, perfectly empty space, waiting to be used.",

Not to mention the star map data she’d found.  *She and Caz had officially un-broken up that night.*\n\nThe grief hit her unexpectedly.  Iyola curled up in one of the cushy lounge chairs and wept. After a while, she pulled herself together and wiped her face off on her shirt. \n\n**“Eve, please change the image to something else pretty.  No jungles.”** \n\nShe walks over to the dejarik table, looking for a way to activate the game.\n\n** “Hey Eve, if those three are done with whatever they’re talking about”**  - *hopefully not arguing about *-  “**in the galley, can you ask them to come here and play dejarik with me?”**\n\n **“Also, what’s in those pods over there?” **",

The light coalesces into a new, equally breathtaking scene: a slow, silent drift through a vibrant, alien coral reef. Schools of tiny, silver fish dart between impossible structures of glowing, crimson coral, and a colossal, gentle creature resembling a manta ray glides peacefully in the simulated deep.\n\nIyola turns to the dejarik table. As if sensing her intent, the circular surface hums to life. A ring of light glows around its edge, and the projector in the center flickers, casting the three-dimensional, holographic forms of the game pieces onto the board. A grotesque Kintan Strider snarls silently at a lithe Ghhhk bird. The game is ready.",

Until it was broken there was no need to think otherwise.   \n\n\nHe was going to respond but Eve interrupted the three of them with an invitation from Iyola in the recreational facility.  He saw the shift in the man’s eyes as he answered that he was on the way.  Wes calmly stood as well.   **”Vaeros,”** He said to grab the man’s attention before he walked away.    **”Thank you.  You have my word as well.”**  \n\n\nAs Vaeros walked out he turned back to Varda and looked at the timer for Nadia.   Eve was going to wake her up in fifteen minutes.   He wanted to be there.  While he wouldn’t be a familiar face his armor would.   He hoped that it would put her at ease.  **”Eve is set to bring Nadia out of the healing cycle in about fifteen minutes.  Would you like to be there when that happens?  If you’d like to meet me there when you\u0027re ready it could be another friendly voice for her.”**  Picking up his helmet he turned for the door intent on heading to the Medbay.   \n\n\nMoments later he passed through the doors into the Medbay.  He turned his helmeted head towards the status screen of the pod that Nadia was in.   **”Eve, how is Nadia doing?  Is there anything I need to be watchful for when she wakes and afterwards?”**",

The steadily lit corridors, all identical grey metal and soft, indirect light, guide him aft. The ship is a silent, sterile labyrinth, and he moves through it with a deliberate, measured pace, the only sound the soft fall of his own boots.\n\nThe doors to the recreation facility slide open before him, revealing a space that is a stark, almost jarring contrast to the utilitarian nature of the ship. The lighting is warmer, softer. In the center of the room, the holographic dejarik table is now active, its miniature monsters frozen mid-snarl, awaiting the start of a game. Comfortable-looking lounge chairs are arranged in one corner, and along the far wall, the massive holoscreen displays a slow, silent drift through a vibrant, alien coral reef.\n\nIyola is there, standing by the dejarik table, looking up from the holographic pieces as he enters. The room, like the rest of the ship, is scrubbed clean of any personal touch, but here, at least, there is a sense of manufactured peace, a deliberate attempt at creating a space for rest in the cold, empty void.",

Thought began to run through his mind.   What were the odds of running across another Force Sensitive Mandalorian.   The numbers simply didn’t seem possible.

If anything caused him confusion it was that. \n\n\n**”Eve can you compile what you know of the Mandalorian clan, Skirita.   Who the major players are within and where they may be located.

Typically when you move a piece into another player’s square, you win that square and eliminate that piece.  There are exceptions, but we won’t play with those, because you’re new.  Some of the pieces move differently than others.  But we can go through those as we play.”** Once again, she points to the first two pieces. ** “That’s a Kintan, and it can push other pieces on your side one space if it’s next to them.  It moves one space at a time, only up/down and left/right.  That’s a Ghhhk, and it can move diagonally, any number of spaces.” **\n\n**“Oh, and usually you have to remember which ones are yours, but since you’re new I’ll ask Eve to color-code them once you choose.”**",

Knowing what family means to a clan he knew they would be happy to have one of their own back.     \n\n\nVarda\u0027s own recollection from hundreds of years ago only seems to cement the info Eve dug up.   It also made him wonder about his own clan and his Father Cal, the head of Clan Del-Fin.  They were in a precarious situation having one of their own hunted by the Empire simply for being what he was.    \n\n\n**”It follows what I know of them during the clone war.  It’s good to know that some things don’t change.”**  He glanced at the screen and looked at Eve’s face.  **”Eve, what can you tell me of the Mandalorian clan Del-Fin.  Lead by Cal Del-Fin.”**  He took a breath as he waited for what she knew.",

Imperial military logs from that period are heavily redacted, but they report significant armed conflict with unsanctioned Mandalorian forces and local insurgents.

Who knows, maybe they were right, if you didn’t even get to play baby dejarik.”  **\n \nIyola shook her head.  “**I don’t know who this Count Dooku is or what the deal is with the clones.  I keep hearing about a Clone War and I don’t know what that is.  But - what is this about fighting Jedi?  I still don’t know why the Jedi would fight you.  They don’t fight unless they have to. They would have just left you alone.” **\n\nShe glanced at the board to see which pieces had been randomly chosen.  “**OK, the next pieces are the Monnok and Grimtaash.  Monnok has one of the highest ranges since it can damage a piece from three squares away.  Grimtaash has high defense.” ****",

He could still remember the garbled communications he had with his Father after Order 66.  His urgent plea to join them on Raxus Prime and his fathers order to stay away.   Cal knew as well as Wes did.  That the Empire would be looking for him.  That if his son didn’t stay on the run he’d be captured and killed or worse.  \n\n\nIt was the only time he ever considered disobeying an order from his father.  Now another nine years had passed with no mention of Clan Del-Fin.   It might as well have been millennia.    \n\n\n**”That pretty much sums up what I know of what happened to my father and Clan Del-Fin.   If they scattered and went to ground, like my father always had a plan for, the Empire would never find them.  Well not all of them.   He’d buy his time before coming back if he was able to.   Another mystery to unravel.”**  \n\n\nAs Varda asked her own question to Eve his thoughts turned to Marina as he reached out into the Force.   Their bond always allowed them to know the other was alright.  See glimpses of what the other saw.  He hadn’t tried since waking up.   The way Eve made it sound he was shit off from the Force while in cryo.   That meant that she wouldn’t have been able to sense him.  Possibly thinking he was dead.  It was a sobering thought as he let his senses drift out to her in the moments he had left on the timer.",

He pushes past the immediate concerns—the ship, the strangers, the impossible gulf of time—and reaches for the one constant he has known for over a decade. It is a familiar, practiced act, like drawing a favored weapon. He casts the line of his consciousness out across the star-strewn void, seeking the unique, resonant hum in the Force that is Marina. It has always been there, a warm, steady light, sometimes faint with distance, but never, ever gone.\n\nBut when his senses arrive at the place she *should* be, there is nothing.\n\nIt is not just silence; it is a profound deafness where a constant, beautiful song used to be. The connection, the bond that has been a steady, reassuring presence in the back of his mind for over a decade, is not merely quiet. It is gone. Severed.\n\nHe recoils, the psychic shock a physical blow that makes him take an involuntary step back. He reaches out again, desperately this time, a frantic search for a thread that has been cut clean through. But there is only a cold, gaping void. A raw, empty space where a vital part of his own spirit used to be.\n\nThe Force, in its infinite and often cruel wisdom, offers only one explanation for a silence so absolute.",

        "content":  "Since the awakening of his ability with the Force Marina had always been there.  The bond they shared was one the Order had never heard of before.   It was what made them or perhaps just her master, Silas, decide to seperate them.  Neither of them had asked for it.  It just happened.  Was it a result of the feelings and love they had for each other.  He didn’t know but he knew neither of them would ever ask for it to change.   \n\n\nReaching out to her, sensing her presence, had become as easy as drawing breath.  When he found nothing he almost panicked.  Again he tried and again his attempt only resulted in an a profound emptiness.  An emptiness that only meant on thing.   The bond was no more.  \n\n\nHe took a weak step back.  The shock was a physical blow directly on the newly found scar on his midsection.   He felt it ache physically and within the Force.  As his hand rose to the same spot that his Beskar covered he reached out a third time.  Now the silence was deafening.  His mind screamed that it want possible but the reality was that the silence didn’t lie.    \n\n\nShe was gone.\n\n\n**”Marina.”** He said softly.  **”Please forgive me that I wasn’t there.”**  While the words were spoken softly there was a profound heaviness of sorrow and regret in the tone and his presence.\n\n\nA moment later the timer on his HUD began flashing red.   There was one minute left.  He blinked back the tears and pushed the feelings deep.   He needed time to reflect on them but this certainly wasn’t that time. When that time did come he’d be ready to embrace the somber realization that his love was gone.",

The memory of her walking away still felt as if he was watching part of himself walk away.  \n\n\nEve\u0027s voice brought him back to the here and now.    **”Understood Eve. You keep an eye on her and we will do the same.”**. \n\n\nWes watched the timer count down to zero.   As the clock stopped the tell tale hiss of the chamber sounded.  The blue light from within died away and the chamber opened up.  Inside lay Nadia still asleep but on the verge of waking up.  He saw her eyes flutter and her chest rise.  \n\n\nHe spoke softly in Mando’a. || **”You are safe Nadia.  You’re aboard our ship after rescuing you from the slaver ship.  You’ve been in our Medbay for a short time.  You can move but don’t rush it.  There are some clean fatigues to your right side.”** ||\n\n\nHe stood to the side in the same armor as before bearing the colors of his clan and the clans sigil on his left pauldron.   His blaster was at his side and still hanging from his utility belt was his lightsaber hilt.   He hadn’t hidden it yet.  It may have been because of Vaeros.  A known Inquisitor or perhaps he was just tired of keeping it hidden.",

The bed\u0027s bio-scanners immediately light up, casting a soft, analytical blue glow over her.\n\nShe lies there, a picture of fragile survival. The bio-sanitization cycle has cleaned away the grime of her captivity, but it could not erase the evidence of it. Her prisoner\u0027s smock, now clean, hangs loosely on her gaunt frame. Her skin, where it is not pale from malnutrition, is a faint, ugly tapestry of deep, mottled purple and yellow bruising, most noticeable on her arms and shoulders—the ghosts of brutal grips. She is stabilized, but far from healed.\n\nHer eyelids flutter, a tremor running through her. A low, soft moan escapes her lips as consciousness begins its slow, painful return. She awakens not to a jolt, but to a profound sense of *change*. The agonizing chemical need that has been her constant companion for weeks is gone, replaced by a deep, aching weariness in her body. The world is quiet. She is clean. This sensory disconnect is the first shock.\n\nHer training takes over. She does not panic. She goes completely still, her eyes cracking open to take in the dim, unfamiliar ceiling of the medbay. It is Wes\u0027s soft Mando\u0027a that grounds her, the familiar sounds a steady anchor in the disorienting sea of her return. Her eyes, now clear of the drug-induced haze, are terrifyingly alert. They slowly track from the ceiling to the source of the voice, landing on the armored Mandalorian standing a few paces away.",

He could tell that she was trying to figure out if she was in a worse situation than the one she was previously in.   Her head tracked to his voice when he spoke.   Eyes now alert and free of the drugs took him in.   He saw them dart to his shoulder where his sigil was proudly displayed.  The same flicker of recognition flashed for an instant before looking away.   \n\n\nShe began moving.  It was slow and gingerly at first.  As if she was taking in each movement for injury.   The discolored bruises that mostly covered her arms and shoulders apparently bore the brunt of the slavers\u0027 physical transgressions against her.  Now in a seated position he watched her look between Varda and himself.  She was doing the same thing he would be if the roles were reversed.   Assessing the situation and reading the room.  Figuring out if those that rescued her were friend or foe.   \n\n\nHer question wasn’t surprising nor was the unaccented basic. It was straight and to the point.  He reached for a container of water and slowly handed it to her.  **”You’re on the *Venture* with myself, Varda and three others.  And one other that we rescued off the slavers’ ship, Misha.”**  He took a step back after handing off the water.  **”My name is Wes.  Like I said before.   You’re safe here.”**",

She doesn\u0027t drink, but holds it, her fingers wrapped tightly around the container as if it were an anchor.\n\nHer gaze goes from Wes\u0027s face to Varda\u0027s, then back again with an unreadable expression, a carefully constructed wall of neutrality.\n\n**\"The *Venture*,\"** she repeats, the name a flat, toneless statement, not a question.

The container of water slips from her numb fingers, clattering onto the deck and spilling its contents in a dark pool at her feet. She doesn\u0027t seem to notice.\n\nShe stares at the door to the preservation chamber, her gaze fixed on it, but seeing something far away. Her lips part, but no sound comes out. Her carefully constructed walls, the ones that held back the storm of her trauma, have just been breached by a grief so absolute it needs no sound.\n\nThe tremors return, a violent, uncontrollable shudder that wracks her entire body. She wraps her arms around herself, hugging her knees to her chest, curling back into that small, tight ball of a survivor, her mind once again retreating from a reality that has become too sharp, too painful to bear.",

It wasn’t immediate but when the emotions took hold she saw the physical impact it had on her as well as feeling it in the Force.  Hearing that her friend was gone tore down the newly recreated wall she had erected to protect herself.   With the wall down he watched as she curled up to protect herself from whatever else the galaxy had in store for her.   \n\n\nIt took a bit of time but she finally started to regain some of that inner strength she had.  He knew it was there as he had witnessed it on the slaver\u0027s ship.  She needed to find it once more.   \n\n\nHe turned his attention to the monitors.   All readings were still green but stress levels were still high.   The quietness of the Medbay was deafening but it finally broke when she spoke.  Looking back he witnessed another change in her.   A quiet calmness that was wrapped up tight waiting to unravel.  She wanted to take him home.   \n\n\n**”Right now the *Venture* has its solar arrays deployed.   We’re in the Kinooine system recharging our critically low power reserves.  When that’s accomplished I see no problem getting you to where you need to go.  Perhaps we may find some help there as well.”**  He paused for a moment.  **”Eve, what\u0027s the time left on the solar recharge?   I’d also like to give Nadia passenger status, same as Misha.”**",

She pushes a stray strand of hair from her face, her movements slow but deliberate.\n\n**\"Ten hours is too long to wait. We\u0027re a ghost on the sensors now, but that won\u0027t last.

A place to get parts for this ship, gather intel, and disappear. I know a place. Cloud City, on Bespin. It\u0027s... neutral enough. My uncle runs a security firm there. He\u0027s discreet. He has resources. He can help us.\"**\n\nShe looks from Wes to Varda, her gaze intense.

As for your family, they are right. Jedi are often brought into the order when they are babies, and do not know their parents. I don\u0027t know my parents, but sometimes I wish I did. Having that kind of companionship is often rare and far between in my line of work.\"**\n\n**\"As for the Clone Wars, the Jedi deliberately involved themselves in the war and politics, especially as generals. This caused a massive rift in the order, as it often separated the peacekeepers from the war hawks. I was on the side of the peacekeepers, but due to our skills, we were always used. I did not trust the clones, and neither did most of the Jedi. They viewed them like droids with a human\u0027s skin; I didn\u0027t, but it felt so weird compared to the Stark Hyperspace war, when it was judicial forces fighting pirates.\"**\n\n**\"Regardless, the Jedi were heavily involved in the war, often as frontline soldiers. The issue was that there were only about 10000 in the order, and even fewer as qualified warriors, so younger padawans or other branches of the Jedi were called to fill the gaps. I did not want to be a part of it, and separated from my Master. If I were to fight, I would fight for a people I can see the positivity being used, and not by the Coruscant elite.\" **\n\nVaeros sighs, ** \"Of course, I\u0027m partially hypocritical, as I forsook the order and peacekeeping in favor of supporting the Separatists: disenfranchised Republic citizens.\"**",

Is that right?”**  she asked.  *And there had been another war before this one, as well, the Hyperspace War. *  ** “I can ask Eve for the details.  But just tell me, how long ago was this?  What’s the last time you can remember?”**\n\nShe sighed a bit. ** “It just seems like everything became terrible. The Jedi I knew were explorers and diplomats and biologists, not warmongers. And they were generally pretty OK.  I mean, a few of them were skugholes and egoists, sure.  They were people, like everyone else, just magic people with a lot of rules.”  **\n\n**“Anyway, we’ve got a game to play.”**  Iyola smiled at Vaeros. ** “So the next two up are the Bulbous and the K’lor.  The Bulbous will kill any piece it sits next to for three turns consecutively. The K\u0027lor  moves up to three spaces in any direction except diagonally.  You chose the last two times first, so now I\u0027m going to pick.\"\"**  With that said, she delicately tapped the Bulbous, placing it in the center left of the board as she faced it.\n\n**“You didn’t color code your pieces,**”  Iyola pointed out.  **“I mean, you technically don’t have to because I color coded mine, but it’s still a good thing to do.”**",

It’s been almost twenty years since I was last there.”**  He saw the determined look on her face and decided to try a different approach.  He brought his hands up and removed his helmet.

She stares at him, then at Varda, as if seeing them for the first time not as rescuers, but as impossible, living ghosts. The implications are too vast, too complex for her fractured mind to fully process. It is another layer of impossibility piled upon an already unbearable reality. She says nothing more and simply retreats back into a silent, watchful stillness.",

Perhaps the Force put us all together to help each other.  The *Venture* needs some time to power up.  According to Eve we don’t need a full ten hours but we will need more than four to be safe.  Arriving with no power and crashing or spinning out of control will help no one.”** \n\n\nHe realized he was throwing a lot at her and took a step back. **”You’re probably hungry.  There isn’t much for food but there is nutrient paste.  It’s fairly bland but it will be good for you.

He must have had a hard life, and was clearly a battle-tested warrior. *That scar was no joke.* Being a Jedi in this era was apparently different than it had been in her time. Yet at the same time he seemed sweet, maybe sheltered, in a way.  *It was odd. * He also kept avoiding her questions about how long he’d been frozen.  Maybe he didn’t know, or didn’t want to think about it. \n\n**“So these are the last two we place,” **she said.  **“This,”** she indicated a large reptilian chomping its jaws,** ‘is the Mantellian Savrip. It’s really strong and will take out even the few pieces that have high defense in one blow.  And this is the Houjix.  If it takes out a piece, it can move again.  So go ahead and choose your piece and place it.  The Savrip, I like to think of actually as more of a defender, and the Houjix benefits from mobility, so think about that when you choose your starting square.”  **Really, she should have chosen again, but she was trying to make it easy on  Vaeros.  **“Once we place, we begin. I’ll let you start. This can just be a learning game so don’t worry too much about it.  We won’t wager unless you want to.”**\n\n**“Oh, I should have mentioned this draft variant.  You might have noticed that we didn’t place the Scrimp,” **she said, pointing to an odd eyeless tentacle-beast, **“and the Karkath.  In Spira Draft, once the first piece is lost, the game automatically puts in one of those last  two pieces in a random space.  You don’t choose which one.  Same with the second piece.  Make sense?” **\n\n**“You can go first,” **Iyola generously offered. In the background projection, a pink-hued nonapod wriggled its way across the screen.",

Nadia remains curled on herself.\n\nWes\u0027s apology, delivered in a gentle Basic after the familiar comfort of Mando\u0027a, is a soft knock on the door of her fortress. She doesn\u0027t open it, but she hears it. The tension in her shoulders lessens by a fraction. His logic about the ship\u0027s power is sound; the trained part of her mind, the part that understands mission parameters and risk assessment, acknowledges the truth in his words, even if her raw survival instinct still screams to flee.\n\nThen comes Varda\u0027s vision.\n\nFor Nadia, whose own senses are a raw, open wound, it\u0027s an overwhelming event. She flinches as she feels the old woman\u0027s presence swell, a sudden storm of power that fills the room, followed by the terrifying, jagged recoil of that *other*, broken thing Varda carries within her. It\u0027s a frightening display, but it is followed by a statement of absolute, preternatural certainty: *We will be safe*.\n\nComing from a Force-user of such obvious power, the words land with the weight of prophecy. It\u0027s the first solid thing Nadia has had to hold onto since waking up. She looks up first and Varda and then to Wes, her gaze traveling to his face. The fear of immediate discovery, which had been a driving, frantic terror, is now countered by Varda\u0027s assurance. The tactical risk of waiting has been weighed against the tactical risk of arriving helpless.",

She gives a single, small, almost imperceptible nod. **\"Okay,\"** she whispers, the word barely audible.\n\nShe slowly, carefully, pushes herself off the diagnostic bed. Her bare feet touch the cold deck plating, and for a moment, she wavers, a tremor running through her gaunt frame. The sterile, grey smock she wears offers no warmth and little dignity. It\u0027s a shapeless, threadbare garment, stained and ripped at the shoulder, hanging loosely on her. It ends just above her knees, leaving her thin legs and arms exposed, a stark canvas for the faint, mottled roadmap of bruises left by her captors.",

Her gaze drops to the simple, grey fatigues resting on the nearby tray, then back to the threadbare smock she\u0027s wearing. A flicker of something—shame, perhaps, or just a desperate need for a scrap of normalcy—crosses her face.\n\nShe looks at Varda, her eyes conveying a silent, weary gratitude. She gives another small nod and, with a trembling hand, reaches for the folded clothes, her movements still slow and uncertain. The offer of help, of a moment of privacy, is a kindness she had forgotten existed.\n\nNadia\u0027s trembling fingers close around the folded grey fatigues. The fabric is rough, simple, but clean. It is the most normal thing she has touched in weeks. She gives Varda a single, sharp nod of gratitude, a silent acceptance of the offer for privacy. Her eyes find one of the medbay\u0027s small, partitioned sanitation units, and she moves toward it, her steps still unsteady but now filled with a quiet, desperate purpose.\n\nA few minutes later, she emerges. The transformation is subtle, but profound. The prisoner\u0027s smock is gone, and with it, some of the raw, exposed vulnerability she carried. The simple, grey shipboard fatigues, though loose on her gaunt frame, provide a layer of anonymity, of psychological armor. Her posture is a fraction straighter, her expression still haunted, but the abject terror has been replaced by a carefully constructed wall of stoic neutrality.\n\nShe walks back to where Wes and Varda are waiting, her bare feet silent on the cold deck plating. She stops before Wes, her gaze meeting his, now clear and unnervingly direct.\n\n**\"The galley,\"** she says, her voice still a low rasp, but now it is a statement of intent, not a question. **\"You offered food.\"**",

When she comes back saying that they will be safe for the ten hours it was enough for Nadia to finally relax.   As she looked from Vaeda and back to him the feeling once again needles at him.   It was as if she was looking at him and through him at the same time.  She said okay when food. Was mentioned but she still didn’t seem to be present in the moment.   \n\n\nVarda’s mention of her changing her clothes seemed to bring her out of it.  The idea of leaving the horrible identity of a captive behind seems to give her a little motivation.   When she moved off to one of the partitions he turned and looked at Varda.  He looked at the old woman with a new respect.  **”Thank you.   I’m not sure I could have gotten her to go along.   Can’t say I blame her.  Still though,”**  He spoke softly as he looked to where she disappeared behind the partition.  **”The way she looks at me I feel like she knows something.   Maybe it has to do with Clan Del-Fin.”**  He shook his head knowing now wasn’t the time to ask.   \n\n\nWhen Nadia came back out he noticed the subtle differences.  How she moved.  How she stood.  How she presented herself.   It wasn’t leaps and bounds but it was a few small steps in the right direction.  She once again looked between the two of them and her gaze fell upon him once more as he mentioned the galley and food.  **”Yes I did.  It’s only nutrient paste but it will do the job for now.”**  He looked down at her bare feel and raised an eyebrow.  **”Not that you can’t walk around barefoot but we did secure your equipment chest when we left the *Aether.* Perhaps there is something there you can wear?  Then food.”**  He gave her a small smile as he let her think about it.",

Her breath catches, her eyes widening with a fresh wave of panic. The memory of the trap, the relay, the knowledge that her own possessions were turned into a weapon against her, comes rushing back.\n\nFor a long, tense second, she stands frozen, her hand clutching her neck, her mind caught between the desire for the safety of her armor and the terror of the trap it represents.\n\nThen, slowly, her fingers uncurl. She touches the chafed, raw skin of her throat. It\u0027s real. The collar is gone. The fear is still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it is now overlaid with a cold, pragmatic calculation. **\"Yes,\"** she says, her voice low but steady, the decision made. **\"My gear.

All that remained was the bruising and emotional scars that he knew would remain long after the physical ones had healed.   \n\n\nHe stood there as she fought her inner demons knowing that she needed to do this on her own.   Instead of interfering he stood guard as if protecting her from any and all things that would harm her.  Seconds ticked by and her fingers uncurled from her neck as she once again rooted herself.  Her voice now low but steady agreed.   Her gear then food.   \n\n\nHe gave her a nod.  **”Gear then food.”**  He gave her a smile as he motioned for them to fall in beside him as he led Nadia to her equipment locker and perhaps a small sense of relief.",

They move through the now fully-lit, sterile corridors of the *Venture*, a silent trio heading back toward the airlock antechamber where the rescued chest awaits.\n\nThe journey is short. As they arrive, the heavy durasteel chest sits where Iyola and Dryzan left it, an imposing, silent object in the middle of the floor. Its presence is a stark reminder of their violent escape and the dangers they faced.\n\nNadia stops a few paces from it, her gaze fixed on the Rekr sigil etched into its surface. The memory of the trap, of her own gear being turned into a potential instrument of her torture, is a palpable weight in the air. She looks from the chest to Wes, a silent, unspoken question in her eyes. It is not just a box of equipment; it is a final test, a final barrier between her and reclaiming a piece of herself.",

The fear is still there, a cold coiling in her gut, but beneath it, something else is stirring—a flicker of defiance, a spark of the warrior she used to be. She will not be a victim. Not anymore.\n\nShe walks forward, her steps steady, and kneels before the heavy container. Her fingers, still trembling slightly, trace the outline of the snarling Rekr wolf on the lid, a moment of silent connection to her clan, to her family.\n\nThen, with a final, steadying breath, she reaches for the latch. She doesn\u0027t hesitate. She doesn\u0027t flinch. She simply acts.\n\nThere is a soft, metallic *click* as the lock disengages. No explosion. No jolt of electricity. No signal to a madman. Only the quiet, mundane sound of a box being opened.\n\nShe lifts the heavy lid. Inside, nestled in the dark interior, is the familiar, comforting sight of her black and blue Mandalorian armor. It is her identity, her strength, her past and her future, all waiting for her. A single, heavy tear of pure, unadulterated relief rolls down her cheek and splashes onto the beskar. She is no longer just a victim. She is a Mandalorian again.",

She pushes aside the folded sections of her beskar armor—the pauldrons, the chest plate, the vambraces—her hands moving with a practiced familiarity. She is taking a silent, mental inventory, ensuring every piece is where it should be.\n\nShe gently shifts a small, neatly folded pile of dark grey fatigues and a compact tool kit to one side. It is Derek\u0027s gear. She pauses for a fraction of a second, her hand resting on the fabric, a flicker of pain crossing her face before she walls it off again, her expression returning to a stoic mask.\n\nHer search seems to be for something specific. She retrieves a pair of sturdy, knee-high combat boots and a pair of thick, woolen stockings, setting them beside her on the deck. She is still not satisfied. Her hands continue to rummage through the chest, moving past pouches of energy cells and a holstered blaster pistol.\n\nThen, her fingers close around it. She pulls out a simple, cylindrical object. It is a lightsaber hilt, crafted from unadorned, practical durasteel, its grip wrapped in worn, dark synth-cord. It is not a flashy or elegant weapon; it is a tool, built for function, not for show. She holds it for a moment, its familiar weight a solid, comforting presence in her hand, before carefully clipping it to the utility belt that is already part of the fatigues she wears.",

She had taken another step on her recovery.    There was silence in the airlock antechamber.   Muted noises came from the box as she rummaged through it.  A pair of high boots and stockings found their way to the floor.   After that she pulled out one more object.   It was functional more than elegant and flashy like many he saw during the war.  This was meant to be used and respected.  When she clipped it to the belt he gave her a nod and knew that this was the time to tell her about one of the others on board.  Better to know ahead of time then to be surprised and taken unaware.   \n\n\n**”Nadia there is one on board who was in cryo like the rest of us.”**  He paused for a second.   **”Im sure we were all out in there for a reason.  Surely no one here knows why.  He’s a Fallen Jedi.  He fought alongside myself, Varda and the others to free you from *Aether*.”**  Wes chose the word fallen over dark for obvious reasons.  After the fall there was lots of grey in the galaxy.   As for Vaeros he still hadn’t made up his mind yet but he did help rescue Nadia, Misha and recover Derek.",

She stands, the simple act of being properly shod a small but significant step in reclaiming herself.

The galaxy you remember... it\u0027s gone.\"**\n\nHer gaze becomes distant, as if reciting a grim history lesson she has learned firsthand.\n\n**\"The first decade after the Empire rose... it was a purge. The Jedi weren\u0027t just defeated; they were systematically hunted, vilified, and exterminated. To the Core Worlds, they\u0027re boogeymen now, traitors from a history book written by the victors. Anyone showing even a hint of sensitivity is a target—for Inquisitors, for bounty hunters, for anyone looking to curry favor with the Empire.\"**\n\nShe lets out a slow, weary breath.\n\n**\"Out here, on the fringes... people have longer memories and shorter loyalties. They might not bat an eye if you ignite one of these,\"** she gestures to their weapons, **\"as long as it\u0027s on their side of a fight. But the closer you get to civilized space, the more a lightsaber stops being a symbol of a peacekeeper and becomes a beacon. A target. A death sentence.\"**\n\nShe looks at them both, her eyes filled with a grim, weary warning. **\"It is not a weapon to be drawn lightly.\"**",

        "content":  "Wes caught the unspoken look Nadia gave him when he mentioned the Dark Jedi that was also aboard.   He considered telling her what Valero’s was but when Varda mentioned about judging the man for who he is now and not who he was he simply gave her a nod.  He looked back at Nadia and nodded again.  The same look with a feeling of caution he sent out to both of the women.  \n\n\nAs Nadia stood he saw a change in her.  The act of claiming her heritage and who she was did more for her than anything else he could think of.    Her quip about Varda’s invite being lost when it came to a lightsaber brought a wry smile to his face.  Her humor reminded him of Marina and the thought caused it to fall slightly.   A small bit of regret rose up within him as he remembered how he couldn’t sense her.   \n\n\nAs Nadia started to speak again he dealt with the feeling and listened as she stated the current state of affairs in the galaxy.   Only being nine years removed it was still pretty much the same.  The Empire ruled with an iron grip.  Any and all things Jedi related was dealt with quickly and with no consequences for anyone involved.",

It was about five months before Order 66.”**  He thought back to the day when he left for the Chu’unthor II.  Master Silas had thought it best that the two of them were separated.  **”After that fateful mission I was sent to train with the Altisian Jedi who were based out of Bespin.  Order 66 happened a couple months after that.   I was on the run for years.   Separated from loved ones and Clan in an effort to protect them.  I knew my presence would be a danger to them all”**  He looked at Varda knowing that she had heard some of this before.  **”I came back from the outer regions and decided to help.  I had a ship and got caught up with a group that helped people and families get out from under the Empire.”**  \n\n\nHe looked at Nadia hoping that she understood that he had some idea of what was out there if they weren’t careful.  **”There was a fledgling resistance then.

They call themselves the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Rebel Alliance.\"**\n\nShe shifts her weight, her voice taking on the tone of someone reciting battlefield intelligence.\n\n**\"They\u0027re not just scattered cells anymore. They have fleets, organized command structures. They\u0027ve won victories—small ones, but significant. They\u0027ve bloodied the Empire\u0027s nose enough that the Emperor takes them seriously. He\u0027s diverted entire sector fleets to hunt them down. It\u0027s a real war now. Desperate, bloody, fought in the shadows and the forgotten corners of the galaxy. Every day, the Empire\u0027s grip gets tighter, and every day, the Alliance finds a new way to slip through their fingers. It\u0027s the only real hope there is.\"**",

That wasn’t so surprising, she supposed; Jedi were known to be able to hear thoughts.  *I can easily test that theory later. *\n\n**“Now you’ve made me curious,”**  Iyola said.  **“What you thought I’d be like, and what you think I’m like.  You’ve got to tell me.”**  She placed the Savrip four lateral squares from the Bulbous, its scaly bulk now tinted green. \n\n**“I’m still a bit confused when it comes to this new year system,” **she confessed. **“You’re from (30 bby)?  Or maybe (25bby?) Is that right?”**\n\nShe glanced down at his gem, twinkling in the shifting light of the dejarik holoprojection. It was pretty enough, but credits had never been her motivation.  **“Tell you what,”** she said. **“You’re a researcher, you like to know things, right?  I like to find things out too.  Forget the gems. Let’s wager information.  If I win, I ask you a question and you have to answer.  Same for me.” ** She smiled winningly.  **“Sounds good?”**\n\nShe looked up as Varda entered the room.  **“Oh, hi Varda,”** she said.  **“Vaeros and I are about to play dejarik, the Spira Draft variant, if you know it. It’s his first game of dejarik ever!’ **\n\nIyola folded her hands together as she examined the distribution of the pieces.  Already, the holograms were snapping and straining and wriggling, eager to enter combat.  She lifted her head and looked him directly in the eye.  **“Your move,”** she said.",

The cells were an unorganized mess of missmashed groups.  If they were becoming a cohesive fighting group that meant they got some real leadership.  He had many questions but now wasn’t the time.   He had promised her food and then meant the galley and then maybe the red room where Iyola and Vaeros had gone.   \n\n\nAs if his mind was being read Varda excused herself.   Mentioning joining the others and offering Nadia an ear if needed.    Wes nodded.  **“Thanks for helping me, Varda.   We’ll join you in the rec area soon.”**  \n\n\nAs Varda left the airlock antechamber Wes turned for the galley.   **”The galley is this way.”** As they strode out into the corridor he had much he wanted to ask but kept it contained for the moment.   **”Do you want to get a message out to anyone?

A shadow passes over her features, and she is quiet for several long strides, the silence filled only by the hum of the ship. She can feel his unspoken curiosity, a dozen questions humming just beneath the surface of his calm demeanor. It\u0027s not an aggressive probe, but it\u0027s there—a pressure, an expectation.\n\n**\"No,\"** she says finally, her voice low and flat, her gaze fixed on the corridor ahead. **\"Everyone who would be looking for me... thinks I\u0027m dead.\"**\n\nShe lets the stark finality of that statement hang in the air for a moment, a wall to stop the questions she can feel him wanting to ask. After another few steps, she lets out a slow, weary sigh, as if deciding to offer a partial explanation.\n\n**\"The only ones who would care are on Bespin,\"** she clarifies, her tone still guarded. **\"I can\u0027t risk an open transmission from a ghost ship like this. It\u0027s better to send a secure message once we\u0027re in-system, through channels I trust. I\u0027ve been gone for weeks. A few more days to do this right... it won\u0027t change anything.\"**\n\nHer words effectively close the door on the topic, framing her silence not as secrecy, but as a grim, pragmatic necessity.",

For Nadia, stepping into the room is a stark, almost physical shock. After two weeks in a cramped, filthy cell, the sheer *openness* of the space is disorienting. Her gaze sweeps across the room, taking in the clean metal tables, the ordered dispensers, and, finally, the massive viewport that dominates the far wall.\n\nShe stops dead, her breath catching in her throat.\n\nThrough the viewport, the unfiltered light of the Kinooine sun blazes, a colossal, brilliant sphere of white-gold fire hanging in the infinite blackness. It is a view of overwhelming scale, of silent, terrifying, beautiful majesty. For someone whose entire world has been four metal walls, the sudden, violent reminder of the sheer size of the galaxy is a staggering blow.\n\nShe says nothing, but she slowly walks toward the viewport, drawn by the light. She stops a few feet away, her reflection a small, wavering silhouette against the stellar fire, looking like a lost soul who has just stumbled upon the face of a god.",

He held up a hand to hold off and snap questions.   **”Eve seems to have quite the extensive database.  Seeing.

He listened as she talked about Ghurn and his brother took her mother into the clan and accepted her and her sister.   He nodded.   **”Family is more than just blood.  It’s forged by commitment and trust and it can happen when you’re not even expecting it.”**  \n\n\nHe thought of Fakir and how his family circle expanded by two.  Marina and the child she had not long before they met.   While he never met her daughter or even knew her name, he sensed her when Marina gave him his first test in the Force.   She was still an infant secreted away somewhere safe.  The memory stirred emotions that were long put away so they couldn’t be used against him.   \n\n\nHe took a small drink and let out a quiet sigh.  **”It”s good you three found a place to belong.  A safe place.  The Skirita have a long history.  One that is good and honorable.”**",

She was still unfamiliar with the *Venture.*  They all were if he had to be honest.  In his time spent across the galaxy he had never seen a ship like her.  \n\n\nShe took a seat to his right and he admired her thinking.  It was practical and tactical, allowing her to talk freely while keeping an eye on the galley’s entrance.   She ate in silence and he let her, knowing that when she was ready she’d talk more.  He was looking at his bracer checking on the ships status when he heard the *clink* of the utensil on the plate.   Looking up he could see the look in her eyes as she asked about the Clan Sigil he wore.  Clan Del-Fin.  There was a bit of a surprised look on his face when she mentioned Raxus Prime.  His father and the clan were there on a covert mission when Order 66 was initiated.  Not many knew they were there and he wondered how she knew.   \n\n\nHe gave her a nod.  **”Yes, I wear the Sigil proudly.  I was born into the clan.”**  He paused, taking a drink of his water.  Being asked about the Del-Fin made him wonder about his father and if the man was still alive.  Even though his father wasn’t Force sensitive he always figured he’d know if his dad had died.   Yet being in cryo for nine years so much could have happened.  **”They were on Raxus Prime.  Providing covert combat support at the beginning of the fall.   I was with the Altisian Jedi when it all started.  A small group of us were on New Holstice at the Jedi Memorial when the clones turned.”**  He shook his head at the memory.  Sadness for what transpired and taking the first shot in defense of himself and fellow students and younglings.",

Her nod of understanding told him she was familiar with such situations.  It was a stark reality.  She wasn’t much older than he was when the Republic fell.  The life they led wasn’t an easy one.   \n\n\nWhen she spoke of her mother giving her a similar order it resonated within him.   He felt the emotion similar to his at having to make a choice that potentially had a bad outcome no matter the path you took.   You simply had to live with it.   \n\n\nHe felt her reign in her emotions and her face went back to the one of control and not giving anything away.  When she asked about the Altisian Jedi he smiled.   Apparently her mother was trained by the Main Order.  He gave a small chuckle when she asked how they were different.  \n\n\nHe took a breath remembering the first couple months.  **”Their training and ethics were just as strong as the main order but one of the reasons I was sent was that they accepted initiates of any age.  Since I was just turning seventeen when the order made up their mind with what to do with me I didn’t fit the mold of a padawan learner in any way.”**  He smiled when he saw her grin as she was probably imagining a fully armored Mandalorian with younglings.",

I trained with many masters, learned different aspects of the force and to look at things differently.”**  He paused as he looked out the viewport once again.  **”But perhaps the biggest difference was the open encouragement of relationships and family within.   It was a stark contrast from the Main Order.”**  He took a sharp inhale and let it out.  The memory of Marina walking down the gangplank was a powerful and lasting memory.  One he still regretted to this day.  That he didn’t fight to let the order keep them together.  To let them both go to the Altisian Sect.  He still believed to this day that bond they shared was the issue.   **”Things would have been different if the Order would have let us go there together but…”** He stopped and shook his head.  He couldn’t change the past.  He looked back to Nadia and saw her watching and listening intently.",

That would make things more interesting. ** ”In fact, why don’t we up the stakes?  Instead of waiting for the game to be over to ask our questions, we can ask them after the other player loses a piece.”**  She glanced at Vaeros to see if he\u0027d agree.\n\n**“And it’s not that I am so good at sneaking up on people, though I am,”** Iyola continued. **“It’s that you don’t pay attention.  Like now. “ ** She moved the Kintan into her Savrip, bumping it directly into the Houjix.  The green-lit lizard-beast grabbed the Houjix and tore it in half with its powerful jaws.  The Houjix flickered, then disappeared. \n\n**“Ha!”**  Iyola looked at Vaeros expectantly.

It\u0027s a curiosity, a filling-in of a gap in her historical knowledge. But as Wes speaks of family, of relationships being openly encouraged, a subtle shift occurs. The wall of stoic neutrality she maintains so carefully develops a hairline fracture.\n\n\nWhen he trails off, the weight of his unspoken \"but...\" hangs heavy in the air. The sudden, sharp spike of his regret, a raw and powerful emotion, cuts through her own carefully constructed defenses. She feels it not as a thought, but as a physical sensation—a sudden, aching pang of profound loss that resonates deep in her own chest. It\u0027s not her pain, but it feels hauntingly familiar.\n\n\nShe tilts her head slightly, her gaze analytical but not unkind. **\"Us?\"** she asks softly, the single word a quiet invitation for him to continue, but with no pressure behind it. She doesn\u0027t pry, but she has clearly identified the heart of his pain.",

It seemed to have resonated with her somehow as he spoke his memories of Marina came back with an unwanted reality.  He couldn’t sense her anymore. What had always been a comforting reality, even if they weren’t together, he knew she was alive and well.  Nadia’s question of ‘us’ wasn’t lost on him.  She gave him an opportunity to continue.  While he never really spoke of her to anyone he felt like telling her.  \n\n\nHe nodded.   **”Yes, ‘us’”**  He paused slightly as he sat up a bit straighter.  **”I was sent on a mission to some backwater separatist system to deliver some intel to the republic operative there.  Like always, nothing is ever as it seems and we got mixed up in planetary politics and shady dealings.”**\n\n\nHe took a breath and looked at Nadia. Like before he felt that sense of familiarity and he had no context to understand why.  It was going to eat at him until he figured it out but that wasn’t going to happen right now, If ever.  **”What we didn’t expect or plan for was what happened between us.  Who would have thought a Mandalorian and a Jedi Padawan would fall for each other.”**  He looked Nadia in the eyes and he saw the shade of blue they held.  Something tickled the back of his mind but he dismissed it as he kept talking. **”She opened my eyes and mind to the Force.  Then something else formed and I believe that’s why the Order separated us.”**",

She offers no judgment, no pity, only the silent, steady attention of a fellow soldier hearing a painful after-action report. The names, the places—Fakir, the *Arms Akimbo*—mean nothing to her, but the story is universal. A plan. A promise. A future stolen by the chaos of war and the changes of a galaxy turned against them.\n\nShe feels the raw emotions radiating from him—the love, the profound regret, the sharp edge of anger. Her own empathic senses, still raw and open, sting with the intensity of his feelings. It\u0027s a painful, disorienting echo. For a fleeting, confusing moment, the image of a woman\u0027s face flashes through her mind—brown hair, piercing blue eyes like her own—accompanied by a wave of love and loss so powerful she mistakes it for his, or perhaps her own grief for Derek. She flinches, almost imperceptibly, and subtly erects a mental wall, not to shut him out, but to protect herself from the overwhelming bleed-through of his pain.\n\nShe says nothing for a long moment after he finishes, letting the silence of the galley settle around his words.\n\n**\"The war... it took from everyone,\"** she says finally, her voice a low, somber murmur. It is a simple, profound truth, offered not as comfort, but as a shared acknowledgment of a galaxy built on ruins. She looks at the lightsaber hilt still clipped to his belt, and then down at her own. **\"Some of us just have more... reminders than others.\"**",

With a controlled breath his chest rose and fell and his own defenses were put back into place.  He hadn’t intended to overload her, especially right after going through her own ordeal.   \n\n\nThey sat in silence both taking care with their emotions.  When she did speak her words rang true.   The war took from them all.  For some it took everything, others little.  For the lucky few nothing.  He saw her look at the lightsabers they both carried and spoke of reminders.  He nodded as there was one reminder he always had and now it was gone.  \n\n\n**”The one reminder that we both shared was the bond that formed between us.  We could always sense her no matter the distance.  From one side of the galaxy to the other.  The distance affected the clarity of what we could sense r but we knew the other was alive.  Still separated by the after effects of the war and then the Empire.”**  \n\n\nHe stood taking a step back and then turned towards the water dispenser.  **”Even Eve with her database of information has nothing on her.  It all ends after Order 66.  I wouldn’t be surprised if she had something to do with that.   Despite her Jedi training she was very technically oriented.”**",

A visible tremor runs through her hand as she rests it on the table. The carefully constructed walls she has been erecting since waking are starting to crack under the strain of memory, grief, and the profound, bone-deep exhaustion of her ordeal.\n\nShe presses her lips together, fighting for control, but a wave of dizziness washes over her, forcing her to grip the edge of the table to steady herself.

They must be doing something right to still be in operation.”**  She gave a small smile and nodded at his comment continuing without break.\n \n \nWhat she said about Cloud City and Bespin matched up with what he knew of it in the relatively short time he spent there.  He then noticed something.  Maybe he felt something as well as he noticed her voice begin to waver.  Her hand seemed to push against the table as if to steady herself.   He was already pushing off the counter when he saw her color fade as she worked to steady herself.  \n\n\nMoving quicker than it would seem possible, Wes hurried to the table where they sat.    It either spoke to the craftsmanship of his Beskar’gam or that he wore it like a second skin that he moved as if unencumbered.  **“Hey, stay seated, don\u0027t stand up.”**  He said gently yet firmly as he laid a hand on her shoulder.  It was then that it was reaffirmed that she was still weak and needed some rest.   While the talk and food were good, rest was still the priority.",

It\u0027s a pure, instinctual reaction, the muscle memory of a captive bracing for a blow.\n\nBut the blow doesn\u0027t come. The hand on her shoulder is firm, but steady, not cruel. It doesn\u0027t shove or grip; it guides. The wave of panic recedes as quickly as it came, leaving behind only the dizzying, profound weakness that caused her to falter.\n\nThe strength drains from her legs. She doesn\u0027t fight his guidance, but instead allows him to gently push her back down into the chair, slumping into it with a weary sigh. She closes her eyes for a moment, the simple act of sitting an immense relief.\n\n**\"I\u0027m... fine,\"** she lies, her voice a thin, unconvincing whisper. **\"Just... tired.\"**",

She can enter a healing trance and use the Force to help accelerate her healing.”**  Looking at her he could see the relief in her eyes and feel it in the Force.  **”And to make sure she comes along alright she can come to the Medbay when she wakes for a quick checkup and not have to stay an extended amount of time.”**  He didn’t ask if that was acceptable or the best course as that was going to be the plan anyways.

She looks up at Wes, her eyes conveying a gratitude that she cannot yet put into words. The simple act of him understanding her unspoken fear, of advocating for her comfort over cold efficiency, is a more potent balm than any nutrient paste.\n\nShe takes the offered glass of water, her hand steadier now, and takes a long, slow drink. It is the first decision she has made that feels entirely her own since waking.\n\nAfter finishing most of the water, Nadia sets the cup down with a soft click. The small act seems to center her. She looks up at Wes, her gaze clear and direct. The exhaustion is still etched on her features, a deep weariness in her bones, but the cornered-animal terror is gone, replaced by a quiet resolve.\n\n**\"Thank you,\"** she says, the words simple but imbued with a sincere, weary gratitude. **\"The barracks. I think... I\u0027m ready.\"**\n\nShe pushes herself to her feet, slowly this time, her movements deliberate and controlled. She is still unsteady, but she does not waver. Leaning only slightly on the table for support, she stands, ready to follow him, ready for the simple, profound relief of a quiet room and a place to rest.",

The Kintan unfurled its razor-edged tentacles and seized the Savrip, which shuddered in anger and pain. The Savrip had enough defense to last another turn, but the grapple action from the Kintan would prevent her from moving the Savrip, and she’d lose the piece next turn unless Vaeros moved the Kintan or she took the Kintan.  *It was annoying.*  She pushed the Bulbous over, which began to exude its noxious gas.",

It had been replaced with a weariness he has seen in her features from earlier.   Despite the care she had received in the Medbay from Eve she was still weak and under nourished.  He reminded himself that he had Eve wake her early so her mind had the chance to recover alongside and with her body.   \n\n\nAfter taking it slow and standing she paused.  After a few seconds when she knew she was good he saw her nod and say she was ready.  With a smile and a nod of his own he picked up his helmet and motioned towards the galley doors.  **”This way Nadia and you\u0027re in luck.  The barracks are right outside the galley.   You don’t have far to go.”**  He felt the relief in her emotions as she began to walk for the door.  He directed her to the side that Vaeros was not in.   It wasn’t because of what the man was and supported but she had been through enough and rest was what she needed.  Not potential confrontation.  \n\n\n**”This way.  There’s latrines and bunks on both sides.”** He said as he led her into a crew quarters area.  **”Anyone that’s free you can claim and I’ll let the others know that you’re in here.”**  He paused for a moment as he wrangled with this next question but asked anyway.  **\"Do you have the strength to enter a healing trance?”**",

Vaeros was falling into a classic trap, though it would require her to sacrifice the Savrip.  But she had the Grimtaash too, so that would suffice. \nShe moves her green Kintan into the yellow, bumping it within range of the Grimtaash and next to the Houjix.  The Grimtaash awaits within two spaces.  This would force Vaeros to either release the Savrip - though it wouldn’t be able to do anything else on its turn - or move to attack one of her other nearby pieces, both of which could withstand a Ghhhk attack and counter with a kill.  \n\n**“The Savrip dies at the end of your turn, unless you release it,” **she informed him. \n\nShe glanced over at Varda, who was merrily whittling something.  **“Varda, I’m curious.  I heard you speaking Mando’a earlier.  Are you a Mandalorian?”**  In all honesty, Varda did not strike her as a typical Mandalorian - she was certainly tough enough, but she lacked the grimly standoffish demeanor that so many of them had towards *aruetiise*, outsiders.",

Trying to find that kind of peace... that kind of control... it\u0027s beyond me. Not yet.\"**\n\nShe moves to her chosen bunk and sinks down onto its edge, the sheer weight of her physical and emotional exhaustion finally settling over her.\n\n**\"I just need to sleep,\"** she says, her voice barely audible. **\"Just... a real sleep.\"**",

Despite being removed from the hell she was in training and instinct was winning out on being safe. \n\n\nHer answer to his question before sitting on the bunk had him wondering if he should offer to help.  It meant having a higher level of trust with each other and despite the good start he wasn’t sure she trusted him enough just yet.  \n\n\n**”Nadia if you can’t sleep and maybe want help finding a way through that storm to reach a healing trance let me know.  Have Eve find me.”**  He gave her a nod, having put the ball in her court.   This gave her the decision to ask for help instead of having it thrust upon her.   **“I’ll be with the others for a bit.  Sleep well.”**",

She gives a single, slow nod, an acknowledgment of the offer and the trust it implies. It is a promise of a conversation for another time.\n\nWes gives her a final nod and turns, his armored form disappearing through the doorway, leaving her alone in the quiet of the empty barracks.\n\nNadia watches him go, the silence settling around her once more. She reaches out and pulls the thin partition across the entrance to her alcove, the soft slide of the panel sealing her away from the rest of the ship. In the dim, isolated privacy of her bunk, she finally allows her shoulders to slump, the heavy weight of her ordeal pressing down on her. She curls up on the thin mattress pad, her back to the wall, and closes her eyes, seeking not a healing trance or a connection to the Force, but the simple, profound oblivion of a long and dreamless sleep.\n\n~~---------------------~~\n\nEnd scene",

He seemed to be pretty smart, so she couldn’t underestimate him. He seemed satisfied with the move, at least. Well, she wouldn’t have to lose that Kintan, at least not yet.\n\nHis comment baffled her.  If a mere dejarik board was visually overwhelming to him, she couldn’t imagine how grim his daily life in his time must have been.  *Were things really that bad in this time?*\n\nVaeros then compared the spectacle of the game to an older person watching a  long-running holoshow.  She didn’t quite grasp the metaphor; maybe he was like a person who didn’t want to look at new things?  No, she must have misunderstood; that would be a really odd view from an explorer’s point of view.\n\nBasically, Vaeros was strange to her, maybe the strangest one here in a strange bunch.   *Fortunately,  I like strange things. *\n\nShe moves the Grimtaash forward, which takes a swipe at the Ghhhk, tearing the bird-creature’s head off.  It flickers and goes black.\n\n**“I mean, if you’re getting overwhelmed visually, we can pause the game and come back to it,”** Iyola says.  **“Or we can start with standard dejarik next time.”**\n\nThat said, she has another question to ask, even if they pause the game for now.  **“What was on that white cube you found on the slave ship?”** she asks him.",

Nadia’s sleeping after her ordeal; Del-Fin also mentions that she didn’t want to be near the body of her friend, Derek.\n\n**“Yeah, and probably that prisoner in the brig next to the medbay has woken up by now,” I**yola points out.  **“He’ll probably be loud and not too happy.” **\n\nDel-Fin asks about the dejarik game.  **“Oh, we were just wrapping up,” ** she said.** “Technically I won, because Vaeros conceded, but it was his first dejarik game ever, and he did a great job.” **\n\n**“Did you happen to see Misha in the crew quarters?**”  she asked Del-Fin.  **“Just want to make sure she’s OK too.”**",

And that specific agents, whatever that meant, could be given protector status after some tests were done.  It all made little sense which wasn’t surprising.  \n\n\nShe shifted her talk to getting to Bespin to find out more answers.  He nodded as she asked him about his clan name and his first name.   He gave her a small smile.  **”Wes, is my name.   Del-Fin is my clan\u0027s name as well as my surname.  My father led the clan.”**",

The Clone wars did much to split alliances between the clans.  Some just decided to go alone.   It didn’t mean Del-Fin didn’t have allies.   They worked and supported several.  Before the fall of the Republic he could remember talk of starting relations with Clan Skirata but it never happened.  With the Empire hunting him it wasn’t surprising that many clans kept their distance even after his father and others escaped Raxus Prime.   **”Not really, many alliances and houses were broken apart with the start of the war.  That’s not to say that it didn’t create new alliances.   We were about to start talking with another clan but Order 66 happened.”**\n\n\nHis mentioning of war again seemed to stop further questions as Iyola shifted to what she wanted when they got to Bespin.  He smiled as she began rattling off things she wanted.   Some of them sounded good.   Especially the coffee maker.  **”Coffee sounds good and information.  Hopefully Nadia’s uncle can help with both.”**",

The ship\u0027s main lighting is steady and bright now, chasing away the ghostly emergency strobes and revealing the stark, utilitarian design of the vessel. Every wall is the same neutral grey, every door identical. Without her datapad\u0027s map, navigating this place would be a disorienting nightmare.\n\nShe follows the blue, glowing path on her screen, her boots making a soft, solitary rhythm on the deck plating. The route takes her deeper into the ship\u0027s spine, toward the areas marked \u0027Engineering\u0027 and \u0027Navigation\u0027. The air here feels different, heavier, charged with the low, powerful hum of the ship\u0027s awakening heart.\n\nShe arrives at a junction. To her right, a heavy, shielded door blocking a ladder access down is marked with a complex schematic of a power core. **[ENGINEERING]**. Staight ahead, another door bears a stylized star-chart symbol. **[BRIDGE]**.",

The sterile, anonymous corridors of the *Venture* offer no comfort, only a stark reminder of his isolation. He makes his way back to the starboard barracks, the door hissing open to reveal the silent, ordered space. He nods curtly to Dryzan, who is just emerging from his own alcove, likely on his way to the galley, and continues to his own partitioned bunk.\n\nHe draws the partition closed, the soft slide of the panel granting him a small measure of privacy. He sits on the edge of the sterile bunk, the silence of the room a stark contrast to the dissonant hum of his own fractured connection to the Force.\n\nIt\u0027s then that he feels it again.\n\nIt is not a thought or a sound, but a distinct, psychic \"pull\" from the pocket where he stowed the strange, white crystalline datacron. It is a quiet, insistent hum, a clean, orderly note calling out from amidst the chaos of his own senses. It seems to resonate with the very silence of the room, promising order, promising knowledge. It is a puzzle waiting to be solved, a thread waiting to be pulled.",

Unlike the bustling command centers of the Republic vessels she\u0027s seen, this place is designed for quiet contemplation. A single, central command chair dominates the room, offering a perfect, unobstructed view through the massive panoramic viewport that forms the forward wall.\n\nThrough it, the view is spectacular. The *Venture* has shifted its orientation slightly, and now the colossal white-gold sphere of the Kinooine sun fills the left side of the viewport, its brilliant light glinting off the immense, deployed solar collectors. The rest of the view is an endless spray of diamond-dust stars on a canvas of absolute black.\n\nThe consoles are dark, featureless slabs of obsidian-like material, free of the chaotic clutter of physical buttons and switches. The only illumination comes from the soft, ambient glow of the floor panels and a serene, three-dimensional holographic star chart floating in the center of the room, a tiny, glowing icon of the *Venture* hanging silently in its orbit.",

A complex web of massive power conduits, thick as a Wookiee\u0027s arm, snakes out from the core, running up the walls and disappearing into the ceiling.\n\nThe air is hot and filled with the thrum of immense, contained energy. Walkways and ladders crisscross the space, providing access to various control terminals and maintenance junctions, most of which are currently dark. The sheer scale and complexity of the machinery are staggering.\n\nLike the workshop, the space is impeccably clean, scrubbed of any personal effects or loose tools. However, the signs of long-term wear are more evident here. On a large conduit directly across from the ladder, Iyola can see it: a cluster of small but deep pits and scoring marks, the tell-tale signs of micrometeoroid impacts that have breached the outer hull and scarred the vital systems within. It is a clear, physical reminder of the ship\u0027s vulnerability and the long, silent journey it has endured.",

This object is too perfect, too structured.\n*It is not Sith.* It lacks the sharp, aggressive angles and the resonant whispers of the dark side that even the most ancient Sith artifacts possess. This object feels… neutral. Coldly, perfectly neutral.\n*It is not Rakatan or Celestial.* The energy signature does not match the overwhelming power profiles of those ancient, god-like civilizations.\n\nThe conclusion is as clear as it is unsettling. This is something else entirely. It is a product of a Force tradition that developed in complete, monastic isolation, or one that is so ancient it predates the schisms that defined all known galactic history. Its creators were not conquerors or saviors in the traditional sense.\n\nWith a sudden, chilling certainty, Vaeros knows that any attempt to open it with a simple display of Light or Dark Side power would be a fool\u0027s errand. The key to this lock is not power, but understanding. He has successfully identified the nature of the problem, the first and most crucial step in solving any puzzle.",

But there was one nagging question.\n\n**“Eve,”**  Iyola said,** “earlier you told me that we had to avoid Imperial patrols.  Are you - are we -  rebels?  Or criminals?  Or both? Or are the Protectors?  Why would we have to avoid the government otherwise?”**\n\nThey likely had a few hours before Bespin.  Iyola had some time - and a lot to catch up on.  **“In the meantime, can you send me what you have on Cloud City’s layout and businesses and government and anything else you have?  Oh, and maybe some sources on what’s happened in the galaxy in the past 200 years or so?”**\n\nWith that, Iyola started to head out.  She intended to return to her cubicle, do some reading, and maybe swipe a few more pillows that weren’t being used.",

He sends a probe of pure, uncolored Force energy toward the crystalline lattice, a delicate, surgical incursion of his will.\n\nThe moment his probe touches the artifact, the static hum of his own Shattered Focus roars in his mind, threatening to overwhelm him. The datacron\u0027s clean, orderly resonance and his own fractured connection are like a perfectly tuned instrument being played next to a screaming feedback loop. For a moment, the psychic dissonance is agonizing.\n\nBut he pushes through it.\n\nBeyond the pain, he senses the lock. It is not a series of tumblers or an energy gate. It is a conceptual barrier, a \"gatekeeper\" of pure logic. It is not waiting for a command, a password, or a demonstration of power. It is waiting for a specific *philosophical resonance*. The device is designed to open not for the strongest or the most worthy, but for a mind that can prove it understands the fundamental principles upon which it was built. It is a lock that requires a key of pure intellect and understanding.",

The engineering bay, with its thrumming heart and scarred conduits, has offered up its immediate secrets. It is a place of future work, not present answers.\n\nShe makes her way back up the ladder and through the silent, steadily lit corridors, her mind reeling with impossible histories and an uncertain future. The ship no longer feels just empty; it feels ancient, a vessel adrift in a sea of time it was never meant to navigate.\n\nThe door to the port-side barracks hisses open. The large, central \"Crew Lead\" alcove is hers, a small island of claimed territory. The partitions for Dryzan\u0027s and Vaeros\u0027s bunks are drawn, marking their private spaces. The other three alcoves remain stark and empty.\n\nIn the center of the common area, however, someone else is now awake.\n\nMisha is sitting on the edge of one of the unclaimed bunks, looking small and lost in the sterile grey room. She has changed out of her grimy technician\u0027s jumpsuit and into a set of the same simple, grey shipboard fatigues, likely taken from a spare locker. Her hair is still damp, probably from using the sonic cleanser in the fresher unit. She is just sitting there, her hands clasped tightly in her lap, staring at the metallic floor with wide, haunted eyes, a lone survivor marooned on a strange and silent shore.",

Hi,\"** she says, her voice small and hesitant. **\"I... I slept okay. It\u0027s... quiet.\"**\n\nShe smooths a non-existent wrinkle on the leg of her grey fatigues, avoiding eye contact for a moment before looking back up at Iyola.\n\n**\"I\u0027m from Imperial Center... from Coruscant,\"** she says, the words sounding strange even to her own ears now. **\"I just... I just graduated from the technical academy. This was supposed to be my first real job.\"** A bitter, humorless smile touches her lips for a fraction of a second. **\"Guess I should have read the fine print.\"**",

She swallowed hard and gathered herself.\n\nShe thought  about what Eve had said about avoiding Imperial patrols. ** “I don’t think the ship is going to Coruscant any time soon,”** she told Misha. **“But apparently, Bespin is still a big tourist  and  gas mining planet. I’m sure you can get a ride to Coruscant, or wherever you’re going.” **\n\nIyola tried to reassure her when the other woman expressed dismay over her recent time on the *Aether. * **“I know what you mean.  I trained so long for the SurveyCorps, and then I left in a year because it wasn’t for me.  I think it’s normal to have to change your job a few times.”** *Though accidentally working for pirates was probably less normal.*  “**What do you think you’ll do next?” **",

Nineteen years ago.\"**\n\nShe shakes her head, looking down at her hands again, unable to process the sheer scale of what Iyola is telling her. The idea of getting a ride back to Coruscant suddenly seems like a childish fantasy.\n\n**\"What will I do next?\"** she echoes, her voice barely a whisper. She lets out a short, sharp, humorless laugh. **\"I don\u0027t know. A week ago, I had a plan. Graduate, get a good berth on a corporate freighter, maybe work my way up to chief engineer. Now...\"**\n\n**\"I don\u0027t know,\"** she whispers, her voice barely audible. **\"Go back to Coruscant? What am I going to tell them? \u0027Sorry I\u0027m late, I got accidentally press-ganged by a slaver crew who were then defeated by a group of ancient warriors who appeared out of nowhere\u0027?\"**\n\nShe lets out a short, bitter laugh.\n\n**\"They\u0027ll think I\u0027m insane. Or a liar. And... Rask has all my chain codes, my credentials... he\u0027s probably already flagged me as a pirate myself, a deserter, to cover his tracks.\"**\n\nShe looks up at Iyola, her eyes wide with a quiet, dawning horror. **\"I don\u0027t...

My name on his crew manifest. My comm signal broadcasting from his ship. To them, I\u0027m an accomplice. It\u0027s easier that way.\"**\n\nThe offer to stay, however, seems to land with a surprising weight. The idea of having a purpose, of doing the one thing she\u0027s actually good at, is a small, solid piece of ground in the swirling chaos of her new reality.\n\n**\"I... yeah,\"** she says, the words slow and uncertain. **\"Yeah, I can do that. I can help. I\u0027m... I\u0027m good with power converters and motivator assemblies.\"**\n\nAt Iyola\u0027s final question, Misha blinks, the query so fundamental it\u0027s like being asked \"what\u0027s a blaster?\"\n\n**\"A chain code?\"** she repeats, a note of genuine surprise in her voice. **\"It\u0027s... it\u0027s everything. It\u0027s your galactic ID. Your travel history, your financial records, your criminal record, your Imperial loyalty rating... everything is linked to it. It\u0027s a string of data that follows you from birth to death. Without a clean, active chain code, you can\u0027t get a legitimate job, you can\u0027t pass through a military checkpoint, you can\u0027t even buy a ticket on a public transport. You... you don\u0027t exist, officially. You\u0027re a ghost.\"**",

For the first time, she\u0027s not the most lost person in the room.\n\n**\"Make one?\"** Misha shakes her head, a grim smile on her lips. **\"You can\u0027t just make a chain code. They\u0027re issued by the Empire, tied to your biometric data, your homeworld\u0027s census... forging one, a good one that will pass a real ISB scan? That takes a master slicer, military-grade encryption keys, and a whole lot of luck. It\u0027s not something you can just buy.\"**\n\nShe sees the look on Iyola\u0027s face, the dawning realization of what it means to be a non-person in this new, orderly galaxy.\n\n**\"Yeah,\"** Misha says softly, her voice losing its bitter edge and taking on a quiet, shared melancholy. **\"I guess we both are.\"**\n\nThe heavy silence hangs between them for a moment, the shared weight of their impossible situations. Misha looks away, breaking the intensity of the moment. She clears her throat, deliberately shifting the topic to something more tangible, more technical—a problem she can understand.\n\n**\"So,\"** she says, her voice quiet but regaining a bit of its professional focus. **\"Eve said there are maintenance droids on board, but they\u0027re all offline. If we\u0027re going to get this ship running properly, that\u0027s probably where we should start. Even if we get the parts on Bespin, we\u0027ll need the extra hands to install them.\"** She looks back at Iyola, a flicker of her old, capable self returning. **\"Do you know where the droid bay is?\"**",

You have friends here.  We’ll figure it out.” **\n\n*Was she trying to convince MIsha, or herself?* \n\nAfter Misha left, Iyola went to the other bunks and collected a few more pillows. Then she visited the cleaners, sighing as she saw the basic condition of the facilities.   *Looks like the base camp on Abafar. *She mentally added scented bubbling soap and hair wash to her Bespin shopping list.  \n\nShe undressed and stood in the cleaners, feeling the vibrations weakly scrub away the misting water.  Her mind turned back to her situation.\n\n*I don’t have my friends or my family with me.  Or my Caz.  I don’t have anything I’ve worked for. The galaxy is a nightmare. I don’t exist here, and I can’t.*\n\nShe started to sob.  At least the cleaners were a good place to do that.  She slumped to the ground, letting her tears fall amidst the trickles of recycled water.  The vibrations were weak.  *Eve was probably trying to conserve power here too.  *\n\nIyola finally gathered herself.  She was used to rescuing herself, and she’d just have to do it again.  She dressed, squeezing the moisture out of her hair first, and headed back to her cubicle.  After creating a pile of pillows on her bed, she leaned against it and started to study Bespin.",

The steady rhythm focuses her more surely than any meditation.\n\nShe breathes with the air around her, letting her mood guide the blade. The act is familiar, comforting—a small ritual in dark times. Yet the sparks of life she once felt within the grand weave of the Force are muted, dulled. That loss pierces deeper than any blade. It is like walking once through a royal orchard, trees stretching endlessly in bloom, only to return and find a single, withered tree struggling to live.\n\nThe knife slips. She hisses as the edge bites her finger, pausing only a moment before pressing on. She always presses on. She always has, and always will.\n\nAt last she leans back, the piece complete, and a faint smile touches her lips at the sight of the small wooden owl.\n\nThe hum of her compatriots has disappeared and she looks up and frowns. Her attentiveness is usually enough to feel people move. By the goddess she truly is out of sorts. \n\nShe smiles at Wes. **\"Ahh apologies, I seemed to have been a bit out of sorts for a moment there\"**",

Misha finds a new purpose in the silent heart of Engineering, stabilizing the ship\u0027s power grid. Vaeros sequesters himself, probing the mysteries of the white datacron until he is met by a final, conceptual barrier his knowledge cannot yet breach. Iyola pores over the ship\u0027s archives, absorbing two centuries of lost history, the name Bespin becoming a focal point, a tangible next step. Nadia, after a quiet conversation with Misha, makes a pragmatic choice and submits to another five hours of regenerative stasis, seeking to prepare herself for the challenges ahead.\n\nFinally, the time is up. The massive solar collectors fold into the hull with a whisper of hydraulics. The deep, resonant hum of the hyperdrive once again fills the ship, and the journey begins—a series of short, precise jumps through the galaxy\u0027s back channels. After nearly six hours of travel, a final, gentle shift in the ship\u0027s vibration signals their arrival.",

Floating serenely in its upper atmosphere is the shining disc of Cloud City.\n\nJust as the announcement concludes, the doors to the medbay hiss open. Nadia Skirata steps out.

        "content":  "Vaeros marshals his thoughts, drawing upon every obscure text and forgotten historical footnote he has ever consumed. He formulates a hypothesis, a philosophical key, and projects it at the datacron\u0027s conceptual lock.\n\nFor a moment, there is nothing. Then, the datacron\u0027s internal hum intensifies, not with the resonance of acceptance, but with the jarring, discordant buzz of an incorrect answer. The pure, orderly energy of the artifact rejects his logic. A spike of psychic feedback, cold and sharp, lances through his mind, forcing him to pull back with a grimace of pain.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle eludes him. He has identified the lock, he understands its nature, but the specific philosophy of its creators remains a frustrating, maddening enigma. The datacron falls silent once more, its secrets still safely locked away, waiting for a key he does not yet possess. The path forward is not one of deduction, but of discovery.",

The scene before him is one of quiet, fragile aftermath.\n\nHe sees Nadia and Misha sitting at one of the far tables, silhouetted against the brilliant, burning star in the viewport. Misha isn\u0027t eating; she is simply watching Nadia with a look of profound, helpless empathy.\n\nNadia is the center of the room\u0027s unspoken weight. She is pale, her face visibly tear-streaked, though the storm of her grief has clearly passed. Her expression is utterly vacant, hollowed out. Her gaze is fixed on the table in front of her, seeing nothing. Her hand, trembling almost imperceptibly, lifts a cup of water to her lips. She sips, her movements slow and mechanical, as if the simple act requires all of her remaining concentration.\n\nWes has no context for what has just transpired, no knowledge of the breakdown or the quiet offering of comfort. He sees only the result: a young woman who looks as if her spirit has just been scoured clean, and another who seems to have no idea what to do next.\n\nWes Del-Fin (@yogi_001)",

The images brought Wes back to when he first arrived here to join the Altisian Jedi aboard the Chu’unthor.  It was a time of happiness and sorrow for him.  Happy to begin his training and sorrow that the Order had decided to separate him from the woman he was in love with.    \n\n\nThe telltale sounds of heavy boots on the deck plating told him someone was coming.  Opening his senses up he felt the presence of Nadia coming closer.   As she entered he turned his head.   It was a pleasant surprise to see her in her armor.  The look on her face matched the calm he felt through the Force.  He gave her a small smile and a nod as she spoke to Eve.  **”I’ll wait for the response and take us in.  Eve, you may want to dock us.   Flying this boat is one thing but docking this thing the first time out.    Well I don’t want to scratch your paint.”**  He said with a smile as his hands waited at the controls.",

Stepping through the threshold into the galley he saw that it was empty except for the two new crew members.   Nadia and Misha were seated in the far corner.  There was a seriousness in the air and between the two women there were looks of being lost, unsure and not knowing what to do.    \n\n\nHe nodded at Misha who looked up as he entered.  With a quick nod at the paste and water dispensers he grabbed a drink before walking over to the table that was shared by the two women who had just shared an ordeal.  Terror at the hands of the slavers and the death of a friend.  He couldn’t personally speak to the horrors of the first but the second he was well versed.  \n\n\nClosing on the table he could see the far off look that Nadia held and the questioning one Misha did little to hide.  **”I’d ask how you two were doing but I have a feeling I might have an idea of the answer.”**  He paused for a second and gestured to their table.  **”May I join you?”**",

He had data... old Republic survey charts, energy signature analysis... He even had this other thing he was obsessed with for a few days. It was some weird, milky-white crystal artifact. He was convinced it was part of the puzzle, a key or a map. He spent days trying to get it to open, but he couldn\u0027t crack it. Finally, he got furious, called it worthless junk, and had one of the thugs toss it in a salvage locker.\"**",

He wanted her to feel that she was a part of this, not the cause.  \n\n\nHe waited as he saw her furrow her brow.  It looked like she was trying to remember something. He had been getting information on where to look.  But who would know where to look for them?  Only one answer came to mind.  These ‘Protectors’ that Eve mentioned.   When she mentioned an artifact he raised an eyebrow.  That he couldn’t open it by any means available to him made him think of something Force related.   But how he came to have it and who gave it to him was yet another mystery.  This one thought raised his curiosity.  **”What did it look like?  Size and shape?  Did this milky white appearance shift and move as if on its own accord?  Here’s maybe the more important question.  What was Rask to do with this ship and its cargo, and I mean the five of us that were in cryo, when he took it over?”**",

I can’t even remember what happened, I just know that I - pushed my  luck on something, and it came back to bite me, real bad.”**\n\nShe stood up to leave.  “**What makes me worth keeping on ice two hundred and thirty kriffing years?”** \n\nIyola waved her hand at Wes. **“This sucks for all of us.

About the *Venture*.\"** She struggles to recall the specifics, like a drowning person to a piece of driftwood. **\"It was a deep-space research vessel. A mobile archive. He romanticized the terms in the old files. \u0027Protectors\u0027... he thought they meant treasure. A hidden vault. The Protectors were just a code name for the archivists.

I don’t know what that was but I woke up with a lightsaber wound right here.”**  He tapped his armor that covered the scar.   **”I don’t know how that got there.  What I do know is that the woman I care about, I can’t feel in the Force anymore.  We could feel each other no matter the distance.  That leads me to a conclusion that shakes me to my core.”** \n\n\nHe became quiet for a moment and Nadia spoke up attempting to explain the search for the *Venture* and how the Protectors were archivists.   It didn’t sit right with him.  How did the five of them become intermingled with archivists?   Not to mention what Eve had already said.

Other starships—freighters, transports, and a few sleek luxury yachts—dot the airspace around the metropolis, a constant stream of traffic flowing in and out of its numerous ports.",

Cloud City was before them and it was pretty much as he remembered.  The last time he saw it he was just a teen arriving to begin his training on the Chu’unthor II.   It seemed like a lifetime ago.  \n\n\n**”Still as busy as I remember.   I only got the chance to go to Cloud City once before the Purge.  Never got the chance to go back.”**  He remembered where they were going.   While it may have been a “neutral” station he couldn’t take any chances.    With his left hand he hit the manual release on the compartment that safely hid his lightsaber.   With a soft ‘click’ it opened up.  Removing his weapon that hung from his utility belt she carefully placed it inside the compartment and closed it up.   Maybe now he could find the time and materials to install the ejection system he had wanted.   The ability to have the compartment open up and ‘eject’ the hilt down to his hand would save time.",

His apology, his understanding of Iyola\u0027s outburst, resonates with a compassion she has rarely encountered in her brutal, duty-bound life.\n\nShe listens as he speaks of the Force bringing them together, of needing to find answers. Her gaze shifts to the massive viewport, the burning star now a symbol of both warmth and immense, indifferent power. She feels the truth in his words, the deep, underlying purpose that vibrates just beneath the surface of their impossible situation.\n\nA wave of frustration, sharp and bitter, washes over her—not at him, but at herself. She feels the persistent weakness in her muscles, the profound exhaustion that still clings to her despite the brief respite. The reality of Bespin, of confronting Ghurn, of navigating the complex web of his contacts and her own buried secrets, presses down on her with suffocating weight. She needs to be strong. She *must* be strong. But she is not.\n\nHer gaze drifts from Misha to Iyola, then back to Wes, her eyes filled with a desperate, unspoken plea.\n\n**\"Bespin,\"** she says, her voice a low, raspy whisper, infused with a raw, undeniable urgency. **\"My uncle... he will expect me to be ready. To be... a warrior.\"** She closes her eyes for a fleeting moment, a tiny shudder passing through her. **\"I can\u0027t. Not like this. I can barely stand for more than a few minutes. I will only be a burden.\"** She looks at them, her face pale, the mask of stoicism cracking for a brief, terrifying second to reveal the raw fear of her own frailty.",

It\u0027s a majestic disc of white and silver, suspended effortlessly amidst the swirling colors of Bespin\u0027s upper atmosphere. Countless spires reach upwards, reflecting the distant star, while below them, a complex latticework of Tibanna gas processors and industrial platforms extends into the deeper, purpling clouds. Traffic streaks around it like glittering motes of dust – a blend of massive cargo freighters lumbering towards the lower docking ports, sleek corporate shuttles, and a scattering of smaller, independent craft. It truly is as busy and vibrant as he remembers, a hub of galactic commerce and luxury.\n\nThe *Venture\u0027s* bridge is a study in minimalist function. The expansive panoramic viewport dominates the forward wall, offering an unobstructed view of their approach. The primary command console, currently responding to Wes\u0027s touch, forms a subtle curve before him, a seamless interface of projected light and touch-sensitive surfaces. To his left, a smaller, recessed console handles tactical and defensive systems, currently displaying passive sensor sweeps and shield readouts in dormant amber. To his right, a similar console provides engineering diagnostics, showing the power conduits slowly climbing towards optimal charge levels. The single, central command chair is designed for an almost symbiotic connection with the ship, its ergonomic contours and responsive haptics making it feel like an extension of the pilot\u0027s will. Behind him, against the aft wall, two additional recessed stations, currently dark, presumably serve for dedicated communications and science functions. The room, devoid of clutter, hums with the quiet efficiency of a vessel built for long-duration autonomy, its unseen systems responding to every subtle input.",

She looks from Iyola\u0027s earnest face to Wes\u0027s masked one, the weight of his Mando\u0027a words, his *dar\u0027manda*, echoing in her very bones. He had given his word. That, to a Mandalorian, was absolute.\n\n**\"Thank you,\"** she rasps, the words a raw, fragile whisper, but undeniably sincere. The self-doubt hasn\u0027t vanished, but it has been pushed back, replaced by the indomitable will to endure.\n\nShe takes a slow, deep breath, her mind already shifting, already calculating.\n\n**\"So,\"** she says, her voice gaining a fraction more strength, a steel thread returning to its rasp. **\"How long before this ship is ready for Bespin?\"**",

How… impressive it is, in its own way.**\"\n\nA low laugh escapes her, humour edged with something darker. \"**Now, give me a circle of my sisters, a willing sacrifice, and a storm called through the Force, Cloud City would tumble from the heavens in a spectacle no mortal eyes could bear. A coven, a sacrifice, and a nexus of power and I could raise an island from the depths myself.**\"\n\nShe harumphs, arms folding, before the dryness in her tone softens into a sly smile. \"**But then again, I’m only one old woman with no coven to speak of these days, I’d be lucky to summon a cloud or two.**\"",

The comparison of her Force-sensitive companions to such raw, destructive power brings a grim set to her jaw, but she makes no comment.\n\nIyola\u0027s cheerful arrival is a different kind of jolt. Nadia looks at the young explorer\u0027s excited face, then down at the datapad. Her eyes quickly scan the long list of repairs—turbolaser batteries, power couplings, micrometeoroid patches. She makes a silent, professional assessment, her mind already calculating logistics. But then her gaze falls on Iyola\u0027s additions: \"caf machine,\" \"holodrama viewer,\" \"bubble-soap.\" A ghost of a smile, fleeting and almost invisible, touches Nadia\u0027s lips before it vanishes. It\u0027s the first time any true humor has been seen on her face since her ordeal.\n\nShe hands the datapad back to Iyola. **\"Cloud City\u0027s Port Town district,\"** Nadia says, her voice regaining a hint of its natural, pragmatic cadence. **\"That\u0027s where my uncle\u0027s base of operations is located. Kando\u0027s Coursers. It\u0027s a hub for independent traders, technicians, and specialized suppliers. They deal in everything, from Tibanna gas processing components to off-market military salvage, if you know who to ask. They also have excellent cafes, I remember. So, yes. Most of this,\"** she gestures to the technical list, **\"we can source or fabricate there. For the… recreational items, there are many shops in the upper levels of Cloud City, if your credits are sufficient.\"**\n\nHer expression becomes serious again. **\"The biggest challenge won\u0027t be finding the components, but acquiring them without drawing unwanted attention. And the financial cost will be... substantial. My uncle will have the best information on both counts.\"**",

He kept his eyes on the real-time info that Eve was supplying as he became more familiar with the controls.   His hands  as they became more familiar moved with more certainty and confidence as they progressed slowly towards Cloud City waiting for a response to Nadia’s codes.   \n\n\nHe spotted a familiar craft.  It was a twin pod design that had been used by Cloud City security forces.   It wasn’t paying them any attention as it sped past in a hurry.  He began thinking again about how Nadia’s uncle could help not just him but the others as well.   If his contacts and resources were as good as claimed he hoped any information they needed could be obtained.  It would have to wait though.  He was sure that Nadia would be giving an account of what happened to her aboard the *Aether* and her rescue.",

The ship passed through the upper reaches first, the gleaming silvery spires of the luxury resorts glinting under the pale sunlight, surrounded by a dizzying array of high-speed passenger craft and sleek private yachts. These were the fabled casinos, restaurants, and exclusive dwellings, an almost ethereal paradise above the gas giant\u0027s turbulent depths.\n\nAs the *Venture* continued its deliberate descent, the architecture shifted. The pristine aesthetics gave way to the sturdy, utilitarian structures of the industrial sectors that ring the city\u0027s middle layers. Massive, cylindrical Tibanna gas processing towers dominated the landscape, interconnected by a labyrinthine network of cargo platforms and power conduits. Utilitized docking rings and extended berths yawned open, bustling with freighter traffic and the incessant clamor of Ugnaught work crews guiding massive Tibanna canisters onto transport ships. The very air here thrummed with the ceaseless industry of Bespin.",

Wes expertly maneuvered the *Venture* towards it, Eve\u0027s guidance systems flawlessly anticipating every micro-adjustment. With a final, gentle tremor, the colossal ship eased perfectly into alignment, a soft *thunk* resonating through the hull as the automated docking clamps engaged, securing them firmly to the station.\n\nThe distant *whir* of an external airlock pressurizing quickly followed, confirming their arrival at a private berth owned by Kando\u0027s Coursers.",

Even though the Bespin system was his home for only a short time there was a small feeling of home coming that rose within him.   \n\n\nAs Eve gave her input Wes looked out at Cloud City.   **”Understood Eve.   Velocity at point-four standard.   Taking us in on the beacon.”**  His hands moved more smoothly across the controls as the *Venture’s* engines were given more power and they all felt the ship move.   \n\n\nHaving Eve made the descent to where the transmission directed much easier.  He was able to fly the ship without having to monitor all the other craft that flew by at various speeds in the organized chaos that came with large stations or settlements.  It wasn’t long until they had left the chaos of the spacelanes above and were pulling up alongside a large docking ring.  **”Feel free to bring us in Eve.”**  He said as he removed his hands from the controls but left them at the edges in case he needed to help or take over.   Moments later they all heard the clanks and clangs of the airlock attaching and pressurizing.   **”Nicely. Done Eve.  Make sure we’re secure to the station.”**\n\n\nHe swiveled the pilot\u0027s chair around and looked at those still there in the cockpit.  The face of his helmet showed no emotion but there was a smile concealed beneath. He looked at Nadia.   They were two warriors that shared a culture yet came from different Clans.  They were all in a sense starting over.",

She then turns to Varda, her initial focus on the older woman\u0027s question of Bespin\u0027s greenery, but then the plea of feeling grass between toes gives her pause. A part of her understands that profound weariness, the desperate need for grounding.\n\n**\"Cloud City,\"** Nadia says, her voice measured and a touch distant, **\"is primarily a center of commerce, mining, and leisure. There are indeed public gardens in the tourist districts, often integrated into the promenades and skywalks. Small, curated, but well-maintained. Clean air, fresh greenery. The air is filtered and clean throughout most of the city.\"**\n\nShe pauses, looking at Varda with a newfound, subtle empathy. **\"I know of a few spots. Should you wish to... reconnect with the natural world... after we meet with my uncle, I can direct you. However, access to the deeper, less cultivated natural reserves on Bespin, outside the city, would require dedicated transport, a much longer journey, and additional security clearances.\"**",

The air and mystery of the person under the helmet is what often gave a Mandalorian an edge in all dealings within the galaxy.  People had an idea, a preconceived notion of knowing who and what a Mandalorian is beneath the helmet and armor.  While they weren’t exactly wrong they weren’t right either.   They weren’t emotionless machines that thrived on killing.  They thrived on living.   In doing that though, sometimes things and people were killed.  \n\n\nAs Varda posed a question about finding some grass for her toes to enjoy he turned back to the controls and made sure things were secure.  As to Eve’s earlier response to be ‘tied down’ so to speak, all was looking good.  **”Hold the fort Eve.  If anyone comes around looking to get aboard that doesn’t have permission contact us for verification.”**  With the final command given to Eve he turned in the chair and stood.  \n\n\n**”The *Venture* and Eve are secure to the station.  We’re good to go.”**  He looked at everyone assembled and then went back to Nadia.  **”What kind of response are you expecting on the other side of that docking ring?  You were missing for some time.   An unknown and unfamiliar cruiser shows up broadcasting your command codes will surely raise some alarm.  They will be ready for anything.”**",

Varda wanted to see a park, which was the last thing that interested Iyola on Bespin - a manicured patch of grass.  She wanted to see the city, the people, what it was like now, in this new time.  \n\n*You don’t have an ID. * She ignored the thought, or tried to.  She’d figure it out as she went.\n\n“I’m ready,” said Iyola.  “Let’s go!

Beyond it is a section of Ghurn\u0027s private hangar: a vast, well-lit space, meticulously organized. To their left, a sleek NovaSword fighter gleams under the fluorescent lights. Beyond it, larger transport vessels are docked in adjacent bays including a Citadel-Class cruiser, with its  fins folded up, and a YT-2000. The air in the hangar is clean and crisp, carrying faint undertones of hydraulic fluid and polished metal.\n\nStanding just beyond the *Venture*\u0027s airlock ramp, observing their exit with calm, professional intensity, is a small reception party. Two armored figures in gray and black Mandalorian-style gear, their faces concealed by visored helmets, form a vigilant guard. Beside them, two squat, multi-limbed general-purpose security droids are powered on and active, their optical sensors sweeping the scene. The atmosphere is tense, expectant, yet undeniably disciplined, a reflection of Mandalorian efficiency.",

Once again he had that feeling of familiarity that he couldn’t place. He had no recollection of meeting her and if he did she would have been much younger.   Still it was perplexing and it was something that was going to gnaw at him until he figured it out.   \n\n\nThe sound of displaced air and the groaning of the durasteel door opening brought him out of his thoughts.  As he stepped out his eyes widened beneath his helmet as he took in the environment.  Three craft that looked well cared for and a small security team.  Wes made sure that Nadia led the way out.  He wanted the security team to see her first.   Seeing her walk out freely and unhindered would do well to immediately lower the tension he could feel within the Force.    \n\n\nSlowly and with non threatening movements he followed Nadia with the others close behind.   He caught the looks from the two guards as they looked him over.   He was used to people looking at him as he walked into places.  His appearance often made people uneasy.  Right now he could sense more uncertainty and curiosity.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e On [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

A mask settles over her, and the Witch of Dathomir, proud, dangerous, steeped in storm and shadow. Is gone.\n\nIn her place toddles a dotty old grandmother. Her shoulders hunch ever so slightly, her stride shortens into a careful shuffle, she holds out an arm to anyone who might help her down the ramp. She peers around with owlish curiosity, her fingers running through her hair as if a nervous tick. A faint, toothy smile tugs at her lips as she mutters half to herself, \"**Oh, such a draft… I hope they’ve not skimped on the heating.**\"\n\nEven her Force presence softens, folding in on itself. The pressure that once clung to her companions like a storm on the horizon ebbs away, replaced by something faint and muddled, like the flicker of a candle glimpsed through fog. Where there had been weight, there is only the drifting calm of age, dotty and harmless.\n\nWhere once her eyes burned with arcane fire, now they twinkle with absentminded warmth. She fusses with her staff like it’s a walking stick, tapping it lightly on the floor as though checking the ground. And if anyone looks twice, they might wonder: was that terrible sorceress ever here at all, or only this harmless, wandering crone?",

She raises her left forearm, a small panel on her vambrace sliding open with a soft *whirr*.\n\n**\"Nadia Skirata,\"** she states clearly, her vocoder modulating her voice into a firm, resonant tone. A focused beam of light from her vambrace projects a string of encrypted Mandalorian characters onto the lead enforcer\u0027s chest plate. The codes shimmer briefly, undeniable, authoritative.

The female Mandalorian beside him stands vigilant beside him, her carbine at the ready but not threatening.  The two security droids beside him also freeze, their optical sensors fixing on Nadia before their internal indicator lights flash green.\n\nA profound, almost palpable, shift in tension immediately drains from the lead Mandalorian\u0027s posture. The rigid vigilance softens into something akin to immense, tightly reined-in relief. He moves, a rapid, fluid motion that belies his armor\u0027s bulk. In a breach of strict protocol, he steps forward, bypassing the general identification procedures, and takes Nadia\u0027s shoulders in his hands. There is no traditional Mandalorian embrace, no effusive greeting, only the firm, familiar grip of a loyal comrade.",

Arno, without another word, quickly motions to Nadia, indicating she should follow him deeper into the station.

She wondered why there were so many more Concordians.  *Was there a war?  Did they win?  *\n\nVarda was wobbling.  “**Are you OK, Varda?”** Iyola said with concern.  The older woman had seemed to be very fit and mobile on the Venture, but now she was practically falling over.  **“I’m sure we can find a place for you to sit once we get where we’re going.”**\n\nOne of the Mandalorians, Kella, still wearing her helmet, escorted them into a maze of corridors and rooms.  Two large droids clomped behind them.  Kella told them not to comm anyone, and that was fine, there was no one for Iyola to comm. \n\nIyola concentrated on committing the layout and path of this place to memory.  She hoped there was caf where they were going.",

Granted his code would be out of date but he hoped that it would still be useful if the chance ever arose.  Hoping that his father never gave up hope after he went into cryo.  Either way clan Skirata took security very seriously and that was a very good thing.   \n\n\nAfter confirming that the group was under the protection of the Skirata.  Wes did relax.   The major part of the reunion with Nadia and her own complete and they could all relax a bit more.   He watched Nadia’s posture and composure as she spoke.   Gone was the tired and emotional and physical tiredness that she was displaying only hours earlier.   He understood now that she held a position of significant importance.   Any weakness would be questioned and they had no idea what she had been through.   \n\n\nAs they were introduced to the two Mandalorians Wes watched as they looked them all over.  He noticed the almost imperceptible lingering glance that Arno gave him.  Wes simply gave the man a slight nod in greeting.  \n\n\nNadia wasted no time and within no time she was leading with Arno as Kella instructed them to follow her to the meeting room that was mentioned as Gamma.   Even though the tension was significantly reduced there was still the order of no comms traffic.  With another simple nod Wes fell into line but not before catching a quick unreadable glance from Nadia before she disappeared down the other corridor.   He walked along quietly noting the marks and scrapes and identifying markers on Kella’s armor.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e On [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

The clinical efficiency of the Mandalorians, the imposing armor, and the unsettling silence of the station are already pushing her anxiety higher. Seeing Varda\u0027s unexpected shift triggers a small, protective instinct in her, a familiar human response amidst the alien strangeness.\n\n**\"Are... are you alright?\"** Misha asks, her voice a soft, hesitant whisper, barely audible over the measured clomp of the security droids. She takes a tentative step closer to Varda, her gaze earnest and a little frightened. **\"I can... I can walk with you, if you need some help. We can take it slow. My father sometimes had dizzy spells too.\"** Her offer is genuine, born of empathy and a desire to be useful, however small the gesture.",

The tired creases at the corners of her mouth ease into a smile. \"**Ah… you are kind to notice,**\" she murmurs. \"**I assure you, it will pass. The atmosphere, I think.**\" Her voice carries both gratitude and a quiet ache. \"**It would be a pleasure to walk with you.**\"\n\nWith a small motion, she slips her arm through Misha’s, leaning into the gesture, not as one infirm, but as one who accepts the bond being offered. The contact draws a warmer smile to her face, fleeting but genuine. \"**You know,**\" she says after a moment’s silence, her tone light and threaded with nostalgia as they fall in step behind the armoured Mandalorians, \"**in some aspects you remind me of a woman I once knew. Fierce in heart, though she never believed it of herself. Always reaching outward, even when her own hands trembled.**\" She gives a soft hum, almost to herself. \"**Yes… doubly so in you.**\"\n\nHer gaze drifts ahead, eyes unfocusing, as though another time and place are layered over the present. \"**She walked beside me once, much as you do now.**\" Her voice trails into quiet, the words half-spoken to Misha, half-whispered to memory.",

The genuine warmth is a stark contrast to the cold scrutiny she’s come to expect, and it momentarily disarms her. The offer to walk together, the acceptance of her small gesture of concern, brings a fragile comfort she hasn\u0027t felt in weeks. She lets out a soft, almost imperceptible sigh of relief.\n\n**\"Oh. Um. Thank you,\"** Misha whispers, clearly unaccustomed to such open warmth. The compliment, \"fierce in heart,\" seems to baffle her, a concept entirely at odds with her self-perception. She shakes her head slightly, a nervous twitch, and offers a weak, almost embarrassed smile. **\"I... I don\u0027t think I\u0027m very fierce. More... scared, mostly. And tired.\"**\n\nShe listens intently as Varda speaks of the woman she once knew, her brow furrowing in a mixture of confusion and polite interest. The words about trembling hands resonate with her own constant anxiety, and for a moment, a strange, unexpected flicker of recognition passes through her tired eyes, a connection she can\u0027t quite grasp.\n\n**\"She sounds like... she sounded important,\"** Misha murmurs, almost to herself, looking ahead at the armored form of their guide. **\"Your friend.\"** She hesitates, then glances shyly at Varda. **\"Who was she?\"** Her question is gentle, tentative, betraying a rare moment of curiosity overriding her usual fear.",

What he could only describe as a brewing storm had become subdued and passive.   It was still there r but to anyone who wasn’t wiser she now portrayed a feeble old woman.  While she was old he knew she wasn’t feeble.  \n\n\nWith Varda walking slower their guide Kella was pulling away.   **”Kella,”**  He said from behind to her left.  **”One of my companions isn’t as quick on her feet as the rest of us.”**  As she slowed he felt the reluctance and irritation at having to slow up.   He decided to use the moment to ask a question.  **”It\u0027s been some time since I was last in system.

The heavy thud of the security droids\u0027 footsteps likewise softens into a more measured rhythm behind them.\n\nHer helmeted head turns slightly as Wes poses his question, and for a moment, she walks in silence, her dark visor giving nothing away.

Overhead, utility conduits run in neat, labeled bundles along the ceiling. Here, the subtle language of **Mando\u0027a** marks the inner workings: maintenance schematics etched into access panels, storage bay identifiers, and directional markers on the walls. It speaks of a clan that prizes tradition even in its operational core.\n\nThey pass a heavily fortified door labeled `ARMORY`in Mando\u0027a and a sound-dampened section marked `RANGE` in the same script. The further they go, the more signs of advanced technical operations become apparent: flickering datapad screens are visible through transparisteel windows in what appears to be a **slicing bay**, where intricate schematics scroll across large monitors, all bearing **Mando\u0027a** labels. The occasional scent of ionized air and coolant chemicals hangs in the air, mixed with a faint aroma of spicy alien cuisine.",

I think the fact you had to rise up, to save her.**\" She lifts a hand, pointing toward where Nadia has walked ahead. \"**Shows what I see, and I believe I’m not the only one who thinks you have a fierce heart.**\"\n\nThe moment lingers, the fire in her briefly bright, before it dims again. A sigh escapes her, and for an instant it seems as though she cannot tell if the old woman she carries for the world to see  is merely a guise… or something deeper. She lets the thought slip away as quickly as it comes, her voice softening for Misha and the few close enough to hear. \"**I’ll tell you a secret,**\" she murmurs, the words like an old charm whispered in confidence. \"**We are all tired. Every one of us. But what separates the krayts from the banthas is a stubbornness not to yield. And that, child, I think you have in abundance.**\"\n\nShe walks a bit further before addressing the question as if gathering memories. A faint glisten flickers in Varda’s eyes, there and gone again, replaced by the warm crinkle of age at the corners. \"**She was almost a daughter to me, in everything that truly counted,**\" Varda says softly. \"**It\u0027s what I hoped my own daughter would have been.**\" I met her in her twenties, perhaps nearer thirty. A politician by station, but beneath that… she could not abide injustice. Could not bear to see others have less than they should. And she risked everything for it. Even her life, more than once.**\"\n\nHer smile blooms as if reliving the memory, her fingers twitching unconsciously against her staff. \"**Keeping her safe kept me spry,**\" she chuckles, the sound carrying both affection and loss.",

Without breaking stride, her voice cuts through the ambient hum of the corridor, firm and devoid of warmth.\n\n**\"Maintain formation,\"** Kella orders, her vocoder adding a harsh edge to the words. Her armored hand moves, not to a weapon, but to subtly block Iyola\u0027s line of sight to the window, efficiently but unambiguously placing herself between the curious explorer and the compromising view. **\"Our objective is the meeting room.

The old woman\u0027s words are like a soothing balm, gently settling the frantic beat of Misha\u0027s own fear. When Varda shares her \"secret,\" a small, genuine smile touches Misha\u0027s lips, the first real one since her ordeal. The idea of possessing \"stubbornness\" feels like a foreign, yet appealing, concept.\n\n**\"I... I hope so,\"** Misha whispers, looking down at her hands, then back up at Varda with earnest, watery eyes.\n\nThe story of Varda\u0027s friend, the \"daughter in heart,\" a politician who fought for justice, captivates Misha. Her mind, usually occupied with technical readouts and logistical problems, now paints a vivid picture of a strong, principled woman. **\"She sounds amazing,\"** Misha says, her voice gaining a touch of admiration, the warmth of Varda\u0027s memory filling the sterile corridor with an echo of a life Misha desperately yearns to find for herself. **\"It\u0027s... hard to imagine someone like that, being a politician. From Coruscant, it always seemed like... like everyone just fought for themselves.\"**",

From what he had seen the clan had a significant portion of Cloud City.   That told him that Ghurn and the Skirata were doing very well for themselves.   He had learned early on that the Force works in odd ways.  For their out of time group to have come across Nadia and Clan Skirata was potentially very beneficial.  \n\n\n**”Do the *aruetiise* give you much of a problem?  The Empire I would imagine is an issue for everyone. Even this far out.  They were a problem back when,”** He paused for a second.   **”Well they are a problem for many.  I\u0027m sure it hasn’t gotten any better.”**\n\n\nIt was only seconds after he spoke when Kella turned and spoke to Iyola and then blocked her from looking into the bay.   It was clear they didn’t want any snooping.   While Nadia had spoken for them and put them under the clan\u0027s protection it didn’t mean they had free reign of the place.  \n\n\nHe looked back at Iyola.

She has set herself a goal, and she will see it through. \"**I see many things, Misha Vorne,**\" she says, her voice carrying both warmth and an undertone of quiet certainty. The smile deepens, lines creasing her face like folds in old parchment. \"**Perhaps a future like that is in store for you yet.**\"\n\nHer gaze drifts forward, eyes seeking something far beyond the corridor they tread. Her steps slow a fraction, the weight of her words lingering in the air. \"**After all,**\" she murmurs, tone almost reverent, \"**even the greatest storms are born from the faintest of winds.**\"\n\nBut then, as though catching herself, she breathes out a soft laugh and shakes her head. Quickening her pace as they near the waiting room, she squeezes Misha’s arm gently. \"**Bah, enough of that. I’ll start sounding like an old crone muttering portents if I’m not careful. Thank you for walking with me, dear. I believe I shall go rest these weary legs.**\"",

It was a shift to the public image of Kando’s Coursers.   A very polished public friendly image.  It was different and the first time he’s seen such a public image for Mandalorians.  With that thought he knew that the galaxy was in a different state than just twenty years ago.   \n\n\nFinally up ahead he spotted a door that was designated as the meeting room they were being taken to.   A moment later Kella was ushering them inside.  **”Thank you Vod.   We look forward to speaking with your Chief.”**  He said with a nod of his armored head as he walked past into the opulent looking room.   It looks like the Skirata were doing well in these turbulent times.    He turned as the others filed in.  He looked at Iyola who had been wanting caf.  He did too but the idea of even some juice and nutrient bars sounded very good.    \n\n\n**”Juice and nutrient bars.”**  He said with some amusement as he headed for the dispenser and then the opposite corner bypassing the larger table for something more relaxed.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e On [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

The warmth from the older woman\u0027s touch, however fleeting, leaves a quiet comfort that settles her frayed nerves.\n\n**\"You too, Varda,\"** Misha whispers, watching the older woman toddle towards the comfortable seating area. She takes a moment, a deep, slow breath, trying to steady herself. The meeting room feels almost impossibly luxurious, a stark contrast to the grime and terror of the *Aether*, and a little overwhelming.\n\nShe glances at Iyola, who is already by the juice dispenser, then at Wes heading for the plush seating. Deciding to put her technical skills to use, she walks over to the table, her hands automatically going to the blank datapad in the center. She lightly taps the surface, trying to ascertain if it\u0027s merely decorative or functional.",

It\u0027s not a lavish Hutt palace, but it speaks of significant wealth and understated power, far more impressive than any \"problem-solving firm\" he\u0027d known. He gives a soft whistle of approval at the polished synth-wood, a mental note taken of the obvious resources available here. The mention of refreshments, however, immediately draws his attention.\n\n**\"Juice sounds like a godsend right now,\"** Dryzan mutters, pushing past Iyola to get to the dispenser. He pours a tall glass of the meiloorun juice, sniffing it suspiciously before taking a cautious sip. His eyes close in exaggerated relief as the sweet, cool liquid hits his tongue. **\"Kriffing nectar. Almost makes me forget about that gut-rot Rask called food.\"**\n\nHe takes another, longer sip, feeling a knot in his stomach slowly unravel. He glances at the nutrient bars, his pragmatic side recognizing their necessity, but the lure of actual flavor is too strong to ignore for now. He then backs away from the dispenser, settling into one of the comfortable chairs near the wall, positioning himself where he can observe the room and its entrance discreetly, while also subtly resting a hand on the reassuring bulk of his trench coat. He eyes the blank wall screens.",

He gravitates towards the silent screens integrated into the walls, his hand subconsciously brushing his scar. *Planetary landscapes.* He finds them less distracting than the vibrant dejjarik of the recreation room, offering a quiet backdrop for thought. He watches as Iyola pokes at a screen, a flicker of curiosity, then a resigned shrug.\n\nHe moves towards a quiet corner, choosing one of the chairs furthest from the main table. He sits, then subtly adjusts his posture, taking on a more relaxed but still watchful demeanor. He crosses his legs, resting his elbows on his knees, and subtly closes his eyes, sinking into a light meditation. His mind seems to drift elsewhere as they wait.",

Her staff rests lightly across her knees, one hand draped over it in an almost careless fashion. She tilts her head back, lids fluttering closed, the faintest smile touching her lips. To any watching, she is the very picture of an old woman “resting her eyes,” content in the warmth of company and the relief of stillness. Her breathing evens, slow and steady, her chest rising and falling with the rhythm of sleep.",

Having set his drink and nutrient bar down he was quick to remove his helmet and set it down in front of him.   \n\n\nHe watched the others just as he was sure that the Skirata were watching them as a group.  Even if it wasn’t overt watching it what he would have done with newcomers being in their midsts even with the word of one of their own that they were under the clan’s protection.  \n\n\nEveryone was sitting down other than Iyola and Misha. The two women were looking at the embedded datapad seeing if they could get it to respond.  Neither had any luck.   The room was locked down.  For all intents and purposes they were also probably locked in or at least someone was standing outside.  **”They will have everything locked down.”** He said to Misha.  **”Even with Nadia’s apparent standing and reputation within the clan they will follow their security procedures and make sure we don’t cause any trouble.   No matter what she has said to assure them we’re not a threat.  To them she was gone for weeks and potentially compromised.  They will make sure she’s ok and will monitor us.  Until they are sure.”**\n\n\nHe reached out for the nutrient bar and took another bite. **”Get some drink and food and be vigilant.

The quiet hum of the room fades, replaced by a sudden, jarring shift in perception. The physical space around her dissolves, and she is no longer in the comfortable briefing room, but standing within a different office, a private sanctuary of polished metal and panoramic views of Cloud City.\n\nShe is there, but not there. A ghost, an unseen observer.\n\nNadia stands before a tall, imposing Mandalorian, her helmet carefully placed on a desk. Varda\u0027s inner eye focuses on Nadia\u0027s face, on the subtle bruising, the hollow grief in her eyes. She sees the Mandalorian\u0027s face, etched with a profound relief that is instantly shuttered, replaced by a controlled fury. It is the face of Ghurn Skirata, though Varda knows only the emotional resonance, not the name.\n\nThe sounds of their voices are muted at first, indistinct, as if heard through deep water. But Varda\u0027s senses sharpen, honing in on the raw emotions, the unspoken truths. She feels Nadia\u0027s weariness, her carefully constructed composure, the desperate mental distance she places between herself and her recent torment. She feels Ghurn\u0027s deep, burning love for Nadia, his fierce protectiveness, the cold, methodical rage building beneath his calm exterior as Nadia speaks.\n\nNadia\u0027s voice, raspy but steady, outlines her capture. Varda perceives flashes of imagery, not full memories, but vivid emotional echoes: the sudden, disorienting *bang* of a weapon, the pervasive fog of drugs, the endless, agonizing need to suppress her Force abilities as emotions not her own flood her mind through the Force, the gnawing hunger. She feels the distinct, sharp spike of terror as Nadia describes being ambushed, the swift, overwhelming incapacitation. *A neural stun grenade*, Varda\u0027s mind supplies, recognizing the signature of such a weapon.",

I was a *Bokken***.\" Nadia explains and Varda feels Ghurn\u0027s sharp, dangerous intake of breath, a recognition of the term that carries a heavy, unspoken history. She feels his mind working, piecing together the sophisticated nature of the attack, the targeted precision that points beyond common piracy. His rage burns hotter, more focused.\n\nNadia continues, her words flowing, a shield against the pain. She speaks of Captain Rask, of Vex, of the brutal, mundane details of her captivity. Varda perceives only the cold, detached cruelty emanating from these figures, the *tools*, as Ghurn\u0027s mind labels them. The *hand that wielded them*, however, remains a chilling, unseen presence.\n\nThe true weight of Nadia\u0027s ordeal presses down, even through the vision. Varda feels the deep ache of Derek\u0027s absence from Nadia\u0027s spirit, the profound guilt that drives her. She senses Nadia\u0027s weary determination to explain, to satisfy Ghurn\u0027s demands, even as the memories threaten to consume her. The sheer scale of the information Nadia is now tasked with relaying is overwhelming.\n\nThen, Nadia speaks of the *Venture*, of the people in stasis, of the advanced AI. Varda feels Ghurn\u0027s profound disbelief, the sheer impossibility of the claim clashing with his pragmatic Mandalorian mind. He doesn\u0027t reject it, but he compartmentalizes, struggling to reconcile the unbelievable with the unwavering truth in Nadia\u0027s voice. The raw, guttural grief, quickly subsumed by Ghurn\u0027s iron will, washes over Varda as Nadia confirms Derek\u0027s death.\n\nVarda senses Ghurn\u0027s mind racing, connecting the pieces: Nadia\u0027s mission, the ghost ship, the stasis, the unnamed Force-sensitives. His hand moves to a comm panel, his orders to Vekka sharp, demanding. *Threat assessment.* *Cross-reference with anomalous Whisper readings.* *Threat to Clan Skirata.* The urgency, the palpable fear for his clan\u0027s safety, cuts through the vision.",

Varda feels the Force pulse around Ghurn, not in anger, but in a desperate, overwhelming protectiveness for his *ad\u0027ika*, his family, his clan. The gravity of the situation, the ancient game of secrets and power into which Nadia has stumbled, is now terrifyingly clear to Ghurn. Varda feels his absolute resolve: he will unravel this. He will protect his own.\n\nThe vision shimmers, the intense emotions receding, the words fading back to a distant murmur. Varda\u0027s consciousness begins its slow, gentle return, the hum of the briefing room gradually replacing the silent fury of Ghurn\u0027s office.",

They trail into the creases of her face until she stirs, sitting upright with a faint stiffness. She opens her eyes, and for a moment there is only the distant look of someone who has wandered very far away.\n\nWordlessly, she draws a small cloth from her sleeve and dabs at her eyes, folding it neatly once more before tucking it back into her pocket. Her gaze fixes on the wall opposite her, not really seeing it, as if the past has been laid bare there instead of stone and steel. Her staff begins to tap lightly against the floor, an idle rhythm, almost anxious, though there’s a depth to it. A searching cadence, like someone keeping time with memory.",

The words about Mandalorians are meant to be reassuring, but the lingering terror makes her tremble. She tries to shrink back into the plush chair, her eyes darting nervously.\n\n**\"Oh. N-no. No, no, I didn\u0027t see anyone else,\"** Misha whispers, her voice barely audible. She shakes her head vigorously. **\"Just Nadia... and Derek.\"** A fresh wave of sorrow crosses her face at the mention of Derek\u0027s name. **\"But Captain Rask was a *slaver*. He had holding cells. I mean, they must have had other... other people. Before us, I mean. He wouldn\u0027t have just... gone around empty all the time, right?\"** Her logic is sound, but it\u0027s clearly based on assumption rather than direct knowledge.\n\n**\"As for customers,\"** Misha continues, her voice still low and hurried, **\"I never heard names. The transmissions were always encrypted, high-frequency bursts. He just kept talking about the \u0027treasure\u0027 in your ship... and then about someone else, someone much more important. The one who *really* wanted the *Venture*. The one he was afraid of.\"** She shivers again, despite Iyola\u0027s reassuring words. **\"Whoever was sending those messages... they were definitely not \u0027customers\u0027 looking for a few more bodies for a spice mine.

Might it have figured out who Rask’s customer was?\n\nTime to think of a distraction.  Iyola remembers the odd piece of equipment she’d scavenged from the cargo hold.  “**Hey Misha, you’re good with gadgets.  Any idea what this is?”** Iyola asked, as she produced the gadget from one of her many pockets.",

The mention of \"gadgets\" seems to temporarily override her fear, a flicker of her old, technically-minded self breaking through. She leans forward, her trembling hands reaching out for the device.\n\n**\"Oh! Let me see,\"** Misha says, her voice gaining a fractional measure of its professional focus as she takes the tool. Her fingers, still a bit shaky, begin to expertly turn it over, examining its weight, its strange crystalline emitter, the unfamiliar multi-function dial. She taps lightly on the dark viewscreen. Nothing happens. No diagnostic lights, no power signature.\n\nShe frowns, her brow furrowing in concentration. She brings it closer to her ear, listening for any internal hum or circuit activation. She pushes the dial this way and that, presses the crystalline emitter, but the device remains inert, cold to the touch.\n\n**\"It\u0027s... inactive,\"** Misha murmurs, a note of genuine confusion in her voice. **\"No power signature. And the design... it\u0027s completely alien. Not Imperial, nothing I\u0027ve ever seen on any of the schematics in the academy archives. It looks like some kind of... incredibly advanced diagnostic tool, maybe? Or a specialized remote control? That emitter isn\u0027t for communication, it\u0027s for... directing something, but I don\u0027t know what.\"**\n\nShe tries another series of frustrated taps. **\"It\u0027s fascinating, though! Truly. The craftsmanship alone is... incredible. But it\u0027s dead...\"** She hands it back to Iyola, her curiosity now tinged with mild disappointment.",

He clearly senses Kella and the two security droids maintaining their vigilant posts outside the door. Their presences are disciplined, watchful, a constant hum of readiness. The rest of the station, beyond this core, thrums with the mundane, bustling energy of countless lives, a dull background murmur that confirms a lack of immediate, widespread threat.\n\nMeanwhile, Iyola\u0027s brow furrows in concentration as she takes the tool back from Misha. She holds it, turning it over in her hands, trying to discern the intricate script etched onto its dial. The symbols are unlike any standard Aurebesh or technical notation she recognizes. They are elegant, flowing patterns that seem almost organic, hinting at a deep understanding of mechanics that transcends simple linguistics. There are no obvious \"on/off\" markings, suggesting activation might be intuitive or require a specific interface. The faint, internal hum she first detected on the *Venture* is absent here in the static environment of the briefing room.",

        "content":  "Another thirty minutes drift by in the comfortable, well-appointed meeting room. The wall displays continue their silent rotation of abstract planetary vistas. Varda\u0027s rhythmic tapping of her staff has softened into an almost subconscious lull, her gaze still distant. Dryzan, now with another nutrient bar in hand, continues his quiet assessment, while Vaeros remains in the quiet stillness of his meditation. Misha, still on edge but a little steadier, sits nervously, her hands clasped.\n\nThen, a soft, anticipatory *click* emanates from the door. The heavy, insulated panel slides silently open.\n\nGhurn Skirata enters first, his black and dark blue Mandalorian armor gleaming, but the helmet is tucked under his left arm. His face is weathered, deeply lined with experience, his eyes—intensely perceptive and the color of cold steel—take in the room and its occupants in a single, comprehensive sweep. A powerful, unyielding presence, but beneath the hardened exterior, the remnants of profound emotional turmoil are visible around his eyes.\n\nNadia follows closely behind him, her own helmet also held under her arm. Her face, though still bearing faint, fading bruises, has regained its natural, sharp contours. Her blue eyes are clear, steady, and focused. The overwhelming grief that consumed her hours earlier has been transmuted into a quiet, almost cold resolve. She stands at Ghurn\u0027s side, a silent, unwavering testament to Clan Skirata\u0027s resilience, her gaze direct and unflinching as it falls upon the assembly of her rescuers.\n\nGhurn\u0027s intense gaze falls upon Wes, then briefly acknowledges Varda and Iyola before sweeping to Dryzan, Misha, and the meditating Vaeros. He stops, allowing a moment of loaded silence to hang in the air, his presence dominating the room.",

The word is also intentional, declaring himself more a paternal figure rather than her uncle.\n\nHe gestures to Nadia. **\"She tells me you saved her from the *aruetiise* who had her. For that, you have Clan Skirata\u0027s gratitude. You and your vessel are safe here, for now. But,\"** his gaze hardens, settling back on each of them in turn, **\"my family was without her for three weeks. She was subjected to indignities. And you have arrived on an unidentified vessel of unknown origin, containing... unknown assets. We now have many questions, as I am certain you do.\"**\n\nHe takes another measured breath, his gaze sweeping the room, asserting his control. **\"Clan Skirata offers sanctuary, resources, and access to our networks. In return, we require your full cooperation. This includes unhindered access to your ship for our technical team, a full account of your experiences, and your commitment to assist us in unraveling the mystery of who targeted Nadia, and what this... *Venture*... truly is. We are prepared to work with you. But make no mistake: Clan Skirata protects its own. And Nadia\u0027s protection is paramount. Agree to these terms, and we can begin.\"**",

The energy she’d felt from the device on the Venture seems to have vanished.  She probes the item, turns it every which way, and is actually thinking about licking it when the door clicks open. With lightning speed, she drops the device back into one of her jacket pockets.\n\nThe man who must be Ghurn Skirata enters, along with Nadia.  They’re both in full beskar, but carrying their helmets, which, Iyola had learned, is Mandalorian code for “I’m not actively going to try to murder you right this second.”  She composes her expression to seem calm and stoic, the effort of which makes her face hurt. When they nod, she nods back, just a bit more than they do.\n\nGhurn lays out his terms, which seem fine overall to Iyola.  She wonders how cooperative Eve will be with a team of Mandalorian technicians. Her guess is not very.  She almost laughs, thinking of an irritated AI coping with Mandalorian demands. \n\nThey also want a full accounting of her activities, as well as assistance in pursuing Nadia’s kidnappers and their mysterious patron.  Iyola is a bit less certain about this last demand.  *Just how open-ended is that time commitment? * But it at least gives her something to focus on as she tries to cope with this new time. \n\nShe looks around at her companions. \n\n**“Works for me,”** she says.",

They were being secured without it being said out loud.   They all settled into whatever they were doing.  Like Vaeros, Wes sat quietly and left himself open to the Force and their immediate surroundings.   When he felt the two presences come down the hallway where Kella was standing guard.  \n\n\nWith smooth movement that defied his size and armored form Wes stood up from the chair just as the meeting room\u0027s door was sliding open.  He was already tucking his helmet under his left arm as Ghurn was leading the way in followed closely by Nadia.  It wasn’t surprising that Ghurn was armored up in the same colors Nadia wore.  The man’s face showed a weathered experience of a man, a warrior, whose presence matched the known hardness of the Beskar armor he wore.  The older Mandalorian”s gaze fell upon him for a split second longer than expected before taking in the others.  He gave Ghurn a nod of acknowledgement.\n\n\nHe looked at Nadia who had stepped up beside him.    Like her uncle she also took them all in.  He looked into her blue eyes.  There was a brief flicker of recognition in his mind but it left before it could take hold.  To further drive it away Ghurn had begun speaking.  His words and demands weren’t surprising.  Some of the things he wasn’t sure they could help with.   One thing that didn’t surprise him was Ghurn’s words that Clan Skirata protect their own.  It was something he understood very well.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

Our objective was to locate and assess an Old Republic-era research vessel. Data indicated it was an experimental R\u0026D platform, believed lost during an uncharted deep-space mission from about a decade before the Clone Wars.\"**\n\nShe pauses, her gaze drifting briefly to the faces of Wes, Varda, Iyola, Dryzan, and Vaeros. **\"The platform had a history of sporadic, anomalous energy signatures reported across the Outer Rim over the last few decades, always from deep, unaligned space. Our analysis, compiled from fragmented civilian logs and Republic scouting reports, led us to believe it possessed advanced stealth and data archival capabilities. The organization we were working for designated it a high-value asset, tasked us with locating it before rival interests could, and gave us priority access to retrieve it.\"**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Notable-Allies#nadia-skirata\u003e)",

A friend long past.\n\nHer lips press into a thin smile, equal parts fondness and ache. But she does not bow. She has bowed to no one for longer than Ghurn has likely drawn breath, and she will not start now. She dips her chin the barest fraction, enough to signal acknowledgment, nothing more. A respect for his operation but a rebutal to the iron of his command that he feels he can bear down onto her.",

I’m sure Ghurn’s team will look deeper but I had a thought.”**  He looked from the young woman to Ghurn and Nadia before looking back.   **”Was it the *Venture* that he was considering to be the treasure or what it carried?  I ask because the only cargo it was technically carrying was the five of us.   Put there by someone for some unknown reason.

        "content":  "Throughout the exchange, Varda lets the others speak. She sits back, staff leaned close, and with a quiet click of wood she slides a slender hooked stick free from its notch. She unties a section of her shawl and begins to add stictches to its hem, like the begging of a star chart. Her hands begin the work, loop, pull, thread, loop. The rhythm is steady, soothing, a ritual of patience as much as craft. To any who glance her way, it is plain: her thoughts are not only on the yarn, but weaving through the words laid bare as well.\n\nThe conversation winds on, the details of treasure and libraries spilling across the table. At a lull, her voice cuts gently into the silence. Not raised, not hurried, but with the inevitability of rain finding its path downhill. She doesn’t look up, fingers still in motion.\n\n“**Perhaps,**” she says, “**all are staring too hard at the glitter and not the weave. You speak of treasure, of hidden archives… yet perhaps the treasure stands before you.**”\n\nShe lifts her work a little, the yarn swaying as she gestures with the hook. First toward Wes. “**A man whose lines are drawn in the Old Republic itself. and have not been seen until now once again. When before their lines met a blade of shadow beget**” Then to Vaeros. “**An inquisitor, searching for knowledge as a bloom stretches toward sunlight and who can say what he already holds in hand?**” Finally, she inclines her head faintly toward herself, lips quirking. “**And myself a witch who recalls lore the stars themselves have likely forgotten techniques of the force special to a special clan. Tell me, does that not sound like a library? A library of the Force, breathing, walking, answering when called?**”",

Of course, the real treasures cited by Varda and reaffirmed by Nadia were the Force users - Wes, Vaeros, and Varda.  *Was Dryzan a Force user too?*  She knew she wasn’t.  \n\nIyola wondered yet again why the Protectors had taken her.  She decided right then and there that one of her new life goals would be to find one of these Protectors and ask them if they had catapulted her 200-some years into this dark future, away from all her loved ones, by mistake.  *If that turned out to be the case, it was the Protectors who would need protecting - from her.*",

She must do better\n\n“**And let us not forget the rest,**” she adds, voice soft, but carrying. Her eyes flick briefly toward Iyola and Dryzan “**Not all shelves in a library are carved from the same wood. Some are stone. Some are air.**”\n\nShe threads another loop, and the yarn pulls tight. “**you two are no less part of this weave. The Force may not call to you in the same way it calls to us, but you carry other strands. The weight of politics, the shape of diplomacy, the logic of survival. The brazen bravado necessary in a group of such, all things the Jedi of old forgot at their peril.**” She leans back slightly, as if recalling something half-forgotten. “**In the coven, it was often the ones without the Force who kept its wielders tethered to the world they claimed to serve. Without that grounding, even the brightest star burns itself out.**”\n\nHer lips twitch at the edge of a smile. “**A library is not made only of books. It is made of voices. Of record-keepers. Of the stubborn who ask questions no mystic would think to ask. Without such things, we would all be wandering blind. I am certain you are just as important to this mystery**” The words are offered for both Iyola and Ghurn, Whether they land where they’re needed, she cannot say. But she has spoken, and that is enough.",

Regardless, it wasn’t the first time she’d heard a mini-lecture on the importance of working with non-Force users. \n\n In her second rotation on the SurveyCorps, she’d been accepted to a joint training course on Vinee with the ExplorCorps, the Jedi version of the SurveyCorps. They had a few Jedi guest instructors and speakers, and they usually had a little pat speech about how the contributions of all beings, Jedi or not, were welcomed and important.  Maybe some of them believed it.  \n\n*Varda did,* Iyola decided.",

Especially with Mandalorians who as a rule preferred it straight forward and not roundabout.  Since his own Force discovery he had gotten better with the way Jedi and others attuned to the Force spoke.  Even with that understanding he suppressed the small smile that almost graced his face as the look on Ghurn’s face told him volumes when it came to word play.   \n\n\nAfter Ghurn’s question to Nadia Varda seemed to feel that an explanation was needed and she did so quite well.   It wasn’t just one type of person that played a more important role than another.   They were all a part of this.  The Force had put them all together.   First it was the five of them in stasis awakening to deal with the *Aether.*  Then Nadia, Misha and Derek.   Now Ghurn and Clan Skirata.   The Force having woven them all together.\n\n\nHe was about to speak when Varda gave way for Ghurn to speak but used a different name instead.   He raised an eyebrow as his head tilted.  The use of the wrong name made him pause for a second but he quickly spoke.   **”Varda is right.  Some would call it a coincidence or a lucky break that we’ve all come together in this time of need and questions.  Some, like myself, would call it the will of the Force.  It’s all the same, just a different spin to it.  I’m sure of one thing though.”**  His dark eyes scanned all within the room.  **”We can use your help and you can use ours.”**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

He takes in her gestures to Iyola and Dryzan, the quiet inclusion of them in this strange \"library.\" His eyes narrow, analyzing her words.\n\nThen, Varda misnames him, calling him \u0027Araden.\u0027 The name hangs in the air, momentarily startling. Wes, sensing the shift, intervenes smoothly. Ghurn acknowledges Wes\u0027s words with a curt, almost imperceptible nod. His gaze returns to the assembled crew, his expression once again resolute.\n\n**\"The Force, coincidence, a trap... it matters little what you call it,\"** Ghurn rumbles, his voice low and firm, now entirely devoid of emotion. **\"What matters is what we *do*. You offer help. Clan Skirata accepts it. For now. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement. We provide sanctuary, intelligence, and resources. You provide answers, capabilities, and a commitment to address this threat that has now impacted my Clan.\"**\n\nHe looks at Nadia, a silent exchange passing between them—a warrior\u0027s understanding. **\"Nadia has informed me of the necessities.\"** He then looks to the *Venture* crew. **\"My technical teams, under Vekka, will board your vessel. They will conduct a full diagnostic of the *Venture\u0027s* systems and begin the process of necessary repairs.

Such an endeavor would be... immensely challenging. However, our networks are deep. We can search.

Yes, it is a problem. Especially in the Core Worlds. Cloud City operates under a unique treaty, granting some autonomy. But without an active, Imperial-sanctioned chain code, you are indeed an official ghost, a non-person.

The Empire had agents everywhere.  \n\n\nHe gave Varda a nod indicating that he agreed with her.  While they were in the company of Mandalorians initial caution was still warranted.  Wes knew of Clan Skirata from his time during the war.   They were an honorable clan and their word was a guarantee but a lot could happen in twenty years.  \n\n\n**”I don’t speak for everyone but clearly there is room for trust to grow.

Ghurn acknowledges Wes\u0027s words with a curt nod, a silent recognition of their nuanced positioning.\n\n**\"Understood,\"** Ghurn states, his voice still low, but now with a definite edge of finality, clearly indicating that while Varda\u0027s boundaries are noted, they are not necessarily *accepted* without further assessment. He offers no more discussion on the matter.\n\nHis attention immediately shifts to Iyola, whose directness, even in addressing her needs, is a welcome contrast. **\"Your gems will be converted,\"** Ghurn says, his tone pragmatic. **\"And arrangements for a basic chain code will be made. See Serena Foss, our Front-of-House Manager, in the outer office. She handles all initial client provisioning. Nadia will direct you.\"**\n\nHe then looks pointedly at Nadia, his expression softened by an undertone of deep familial concern, but his words remain all business.\n\n**\"Nadia,\"** Ghurn states, his voice a low, firm command. **\"Coordinate with Serena. Get our guests settled into client quarters. Ensure they have adequate provisions. And tell Serena to send a team for... Derek\u0027s remains.

Ghurn\u0027s unwavering gaze and firm orders, even as she feels his deep relief for her safety, are a stark reminder of the demands of her Clan.\n\nWhen he directs his commands to her, she inclines her head in a swift, sharp nod of acknowledgement. **\"Yes, Chief,\"** she replies, her voice precise, obedient.\n\nYet, she doesn\u0027t immediately turn to leave. Her gaze lingers, first on Ghurn as he stands and collects his helmet, then sweeps briefly over the others. When Ghurn leaves, some tension seems to leave her; her relief evident with the completion of this initial meeting with her uncle.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Notable-Allies#nadia-skirata\u003e)",

The presence of the man lingered but the overwhelming presence and feeling of needing information subsided.  \n\n\nHe let out a breath and stood. As he reached for his helmet he looked at Nadia.  He could see as well as feel some tension drift away in the absence of her uncle.   \n\n\nLooking back at the door where the ‘Chief’ exited from a memory of his own father bubbled up.   Perhaps it was the duty and responsibility of leadership but he could see some similarities between Ghurn and his father.   Two men saddled with responsibility for the whole.   When something happened to one it also happened to them.     He let out a breath.  He missed his father.   \n\n\nHe looked back at Nadia and gave her a small smile with a nod.  **”He reminds me a lot of my own father.  The duty and responsibility of leadership hangs heavily on a person.  Especially when it’s one of their own that’s sent into harm\u0027s way.”**  \n\n\nHe tucked his helmet under his left arm.   Since Ghurn had left without asking any other questions he directed it at Nadia.   **”Ghurn said that you had people that could possibly track down people.  Family and loved ones.   Who would I see to give that information to?   I’d like to get started on that after you retrieve Derek and Eve is set up with having others aboard.”**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

The compliment, the shared understanding of leadership and duty, seems to touch a raw nerve.\n\n**\"My uncle... he carries many burdens,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice thin but steady. She offers Wes a fleeting, almost grateful smile. **\"Yes. Many burdens.\"**\n\nShe then turns more fully to him, her expression hardening back into a mask of grim practicality as he raises his questions. The reminder of Derek and Eve, of the logistical complexities now facing them, pulls her back to the immediate present.\n\n**\"For locating lost persons, Serena Foss,\"** Nadia states, her voice regaining its crisp, professional cadence. **\"She is Kando\u0027s Coursers\u0027 Front-of-House Manager.

They pass back into the utilitarian durasteel corridors, marked by Mando\u0027a script, and soon the faint hum of the main hangar becomes audible again.\n\nAs the heavy blast door slides open, the vast space of Ghurn\u0027s private hangar is revealed once more. The *Venture* looms impressively where they left it, now a familiar silhouette. Beside it, gleaming under the bright hangar lights, is the sleek, powerful form of the *Atin Oya\u0027ka*—a Citadel-class Cruiser. It is a vessel that radiates quiet strength and pride, unmistakably Mandalorian in its clean lines and formidable presence.",

Can’t wait to check them out.”**  She’d settle for some solid Mandalorian cuisine - it was usually very spicy, which was fine with her.\n\nThen Nadia revealed that their new quarters would be on Ghurn’s own ship, the Atin Oya’ka, and that they’d be under strict guard.  The ship was a heavily armored cruiser of a type she didn’t recognize. \n\n Iyola knew she couldn’t be picky under her very bizarre circumstances, but being monitored by armored Mandalorians wasn’t at the top of her list.  It was hard for her to tell if there was an actual danger to them, or if the Skirata clan was really paranoid.  *Or they don’t want us to escape.  *\n\nIyola tried to put on a happy face and walked up the gangplank into her latest temporary home.",

        "content":  "Stepping aboard the *Atin Oya\u0027ka*, a stark contrast to the sterile mystery of the *Venture* immediately presents itself. The interior of the *Oya\u0027ka* is both functional and imbued with a lived-in, if currently quiet, Mandalorian sensibility.\n\nThe main entrance opens into a central spine corridor. The ship is designed on two primary levels. The lower deck, accessible via heavy ramp just off the main docking clamp, houses a spacious cargo bay, currently holding only a few secured crates—a stark indication that this vessel isn\u0027t engaged in active hauling. From the bow of this lower deck, two half-flights of stairs on either side lead up to the ship\u0027s upper deck and the flight deck.\n\nAscending to the flight deck, is the heart of the ship\u0027s command and control. Two piloting stations and two gunnery stations gleam with operational readiness, hinting at the cruiser\u0027s past life as a mobile base. Another short flight of stairs leads directly from the flight deck into the main living areas.\n\nThis hallway stretches towards the stern, lined with doors on either side, leading to various quarters. It\u0027s evident the ship hasn\u0027t been used for a while, but it\u0027s impeccably maintained—clean, orderly, and well-preserved. There are three single crew quarters, one twin crew, two twin passenger cabins, and two single passenger cabins. The two forward crew quarters (single bunks closest to the flight deck) are secured, as are the crew quarters opposite the main lounge, all locked down.",

Two compact refreshers are conveniently located on either side of the hall near the lounge.

The way Nadia claimed it he figured it was hers.   He gave her a nod as he moved past  and went starboard.  Tapping the control panel to the room he stepped in when the door opened.  Having minimal possessions on him he looked around.   The second bunk would allow for him to have a place to stow his armor and go over it later.  \n\n\nHe looked around the cabin.  It was a place to sleep, nothing more.  The room was pretty sterile.  It didn’t seem like anyone had slept in here in some time.  There were no items left behind by a previous occupant.  It was then his stomach grumbled and he remembered Iyola’s talk of food and Nadia saying that the ship was stocked.   \n\n\nAs he turned to leave he stopped.   He needed to get the information on Marina to Nadia.   Again his stomach protested as the thought of food seemed to waken the hunger for sustenance within him. \n\n\nWith a sigh he continued out of the cabin.  After eating he would prepare the file and send it off to Nadia.  Right now it was time to eat and he turned towards the galley.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet on [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

The double doors to the galley hiss open, revealing a space that immediately feels less like a corporate vessel and more like a cherished home.\n\nThe galley itself is a warm, inviting hub. Instead of stark chromesteel, the counters are a burnished synth-wood, subtly scarred from years of use and enthusiastic cooking. A top-of-the-line molecular synthesizer stands ready, promising varied meals, but its capabilities are complemented by more traditional cooking elements: a well-worn stove top and a spacious oven, hinting at hands-on meal preparation rather than automated replication. Shelves above are neatly organized with durable dishware and eclectic glassware, while hooks below hold various cooking utensils. The air is rich with the lingering aroma of hearty, Mandalorian spices and the glorious, robust scent of freshly brewed caf emanating from a well-used, industrial-strength caf machine. A sturdy, oversized durasteel table, clearly designed for boisterous family meals, anchors the room, surrounded by a mix of mismatched but comfortable chairs, some bearing faded paint where small hands once left their mark.",

        "content":  "Adjacent to the galley, connected by a wide, open archway, is the lounge. This is truly the heart of the ship, steeped in personal history. Plush, synth-leather seating, faded but comfortable, is arranged in a relaxed circle, some cushions showing the slight impressions of favorite spots. Scratches on the low tables speak of countless games played, maps unfurled, and conversations had. One wall holds a large, high-definition holoscreen, currently displaying a tranquil, sweeping vista of Bespin\u0027s vibrant cloudscape, its filtered light casting a gentle, calming glow. Nearby, a modest, well-stocked bar offers a selection of varied juices, crisp water, and a prominent display of several bottles of fine Mandalorian ale, alongside a few obscure alien liquors. Tucked into an alcove is a dusty rack of old datapads, worn holobooks, and even a battered, real-paper book. The soft, ambient lighting and the subtle whir of the ship\u0027s environmental controls contribute to an atmosphere of lived-in comfort, where every scuff and burn mark tells a story. This isn\u0027t just a ship; it\u0027s a home, a collection of memories sailing the stars.",

It smelled delicious, fully roasted and spicy. **“You want some too, Wes?” ** she asked, pointing to a nearby cup with bands of ceramic and metal, and pouring him some if he wished.\n\nThe caf tasted as good as it smelled; the spices hot and sweet on her tongue.  Iyola looked around the kitchen. ** “Are you much of a cook?”** she asked him. **“I make great griddle crepes.  I could do that for breakfast.”**  Caz enjoyed cooking too, though the Twi’lek taste profile tended towards more acrid and bitter flavors, which weren’t to her taste.  \n\n**‘What’s your first stop in Cloud City after we get out of here?” **she asked Wes.** “I know Varda wants to find a garden. I thought I’d have to shop for repair items for the Venture, but it seems like Nadia and Misha are going to handle that.  Me, I think I’ll take a look around the upper levels and see what life is like here, in the future.” ** *My future.  *",

His laugh changes to normal sounding as his helmet lifts free.   **”It has been centuries.”** He said with a smile. **”And yes I would like some as well.”** \n\n\nSetting his helmet down on the synthwood counter the smells and aromas of caf and seasoned Mandalorian food penetrated his nose and senses.  It gave him a slight feeling of home with his father.   Her question brought him out of his thoughts.  **”Cooking, me?  I can but I’m not great at it.  Good enough for myself but much of my studies didn’t happen in the galley.   The time I spent on my ship in the unknown regions I had to fend for myself.   So I guess you could say I did get some practice.”**\n\n\nHe watched her gather a griddle and some bowls as more questions were asked about what his plans were.   It was a good question. He needed to look for people.  Marina and Master Chase Davion.   It had been a few months since his last communication with his master.  His being put into cryo has elongated that time to almost a decade now.  He still had some old ways to contact Chase but were they even applicable now with the passage of time.   The other question was, did Chase survive?   As Iyola finished speaking about finding out what the ‘future’ was like he took a sip of the hit caf relishing the complex flavors.   \n\n\n**”I’m not sure.  My father is potentially still out there with Clan Del-Fin.  I have old outdated ways of reaching out but I’m not sure if they will work.   If the clan has reorganized they will be out there somewhere and maybe Ghurn can reach out and ask a few questions.”**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet on [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

I know I ask a lot of questions.”**  It sounded to her like Mandalorians had gone back to their culture of violence.  *Probably hadn’t taken much.*  Wes seemed much nicer than the majority of the Mandalorians she’d met.  *Maybe because he was a Jedi as well. *\n\n**“Let’s see what’s in the cooler,”  **Iyola suggested.  “**Maybe I can whip up something for us  while we wait. I’m not starving, but I can always eat.” ** She rummaged through the components. ** “Oh nice, it’s pretty stocked up.  Nuna eggs, red gourd, fishmeal, bread powder - I could make dumplings pretty easily, if you like those.  And - these must be mossy snapchips.”**  She didn’t recognize the packaging, but she could tell a snapchip when she saw one.  Iyola grabbed the bag for snacking in the lounge.\n\nShe straightened up.  “**Oh, kriff,” **she said. **“I forgot to get Nadia’s commlink.  Do you have it?  I need to figure out how to get my gems to Serena Foss, and how long it’s going to take to get my code chain-  chain code?” **",

Ask away, I\u0027ll answer as best as I can.”** \n\n\nHe reached out for the bag of snapchips she tossed onto the counter.  Opening it up he reached in and took several with one grab before setting it back on the counter.  As he was putting a chip in his mouth he heard Iyola swear.  He shook his head in answer as he chewed and swallowed the tasty chip.  **”I don\u0027t, but I need it as well.  She’s still aboard and will have to pass through this area to get to the stairs that lead down.  Either way we’ll get it before she leaves.

The closer one got to the galactic core the tighter the Imperial presence was.   The farther out like the mid rim or even the outer rim the Empire\u0027s presence wasn’t as overwhelming.   If at all.  He wasn’t sure how much nine years would change that but he imagined it wasn’t much.   \n\n\nHe gave her a small nod but corrected her when she paused.    **”I’m not a Jedi.”**. He said with a genuine smile and a small chuckle.  **”I may follow some of their traditions and beliefs but I’m first and foremost Mandalorian.  Nadia may be the same but I don’t know for sure.  She’s strong in the force.  She’s definitely had training.   My initial training was with the Jedi but with Order 66 and the Purge my training was cut short.  I was on my own for a while but I had one Jedi Holocron and another that I found,”**  He paused as he tilted his head and thought it over for a second.  **”Maybe not found but more like drawn to.”**  He didn’t explain that it was a holocron from an ancient Force sensitive Mandalorian.\n\n\nHe reached for his glass and took a drink before continuing.  **”Yes the Jedi order as you knew it and as I knew it is no more.  It was torn apart by the Emperor and his apprentice.  Lord Vader.  The Jedi who survived Order 66 have been summarily hunted down. Very few remain.”**   \n\n\nHe looked back to the quarters they had all claimed.  Vaeros was in one of them. \n**”Vareos like he said was once a padawan.  From what he’s said he lost sight of what the Jedi were.  I don’t know what happened but he left the order and joined the Separatists and after the Purge became part of the Empire.”**  \n\n\nHe let out a breath and shook his head.  **”It’s all a mess.  Things were happening when I went into cryo.   Small resistance cells but nothing organized.  I had friends and contacts in the resistance but they could all be gone and the resistance broken.”**\n***",

The warmth and personal touches of the *Atin Oya\u0027ka*, a space so steeped in her own childhood memories, offer a fragile comfort, but the demands of the present press heavily.\n\nShe walks into the galley, stopping near the table where Wes and Varda sit. A faint frown creases her brow, a sign of a new concern. She takes a moment, her gaze drifting around the familiar, comforting space, a silent attempt to gather herself.\n\n**\"Any luck getting a proper meal in you yet, Wes? Varda?\"** Nadia asks, her voice a low rumble, the usual urgency tempered by a quiet weariness. She gestures vaguely towards the gleaming molecular synthesizer. **\"Better than the *Venture\u0027s* paste, I imagine.\"** Her gaze shifts through the archway to Iyola in the lounge, a fleeting, almost apologetic glance. She crosses her arms, the armor making a soft *shisk* sound, a physical act of bracing for the next challenge.

He was pretty sure that she was getting some direction from Ghurn to get the situation with Eve handled as quickly as possible.  Under different circumstances he probably would have pushed it off but the situation was unique.   He and the others were the guests of Clan Skirata.  Doing what he could to keep tensions down seems like the best thing to do at the moment.  He donned his helmet as he saw Iyola move to join them.  Food apparently sidelined for the moment. \n\n\nWes fell inline beside her as they walked out of the *Oya’ka* towards the docking ring that was the juncture to the *Venture*.   As Iyola broached the subject of comm codes Wes sent out a broadcast to Nadia as well.  **”I’ll need that too so I can send the file on those I’d like Ghurn to look for.  It’ll be easier than tracking you down in case you aren’t around.”**\n\n\nMoments later across the hangar bay they were at the docking ring.  Kella and a small detail had fallen in with the three of them. And it felt like they were going to Storm onto the *Venture.*  Eve, being more than capable, seemed to sense or see that he and Iyola were approaching since he could already hear the airlock beginning to cycle.\n\n\nComing to a stop outside the airlock Wes raised the channel to Eve.  **”Eve, Wes here.  I’m coming aboard with Iyola and Nadia and some technical crew.   We’re going to see what we can do to help effect some repairs.  They also want to make sure it’s safe to have you docked alongside.  Once we’re inside we can all talk more.  The others have permission to come aboard.”**\n\n\nHe looked at Nadia giving her a small nod.  **”That will get them in the door for now.  We can figure out exactly what’s needed inside.”**  He kept his emotions close.   He wasn’t about to give them the codes to Eve and the *Venture* just yet.  The ship was their only ‘home’ for all intents and purposes right now.  She needed to stay that way.",

Well, I’m sure you’re all going to be busy.  Best of luck and comm me if you need me,”** said Iyola.  She’d been all over the Venture and was pretty good at navigating it by this time. **“I’m going to pick something up in my old quarters.”  **Unless she was stopped, she set off in that direction.",

With a few taps he made sure it was running through his strongest encryption.   Even with thought he was sure it wasn’t as good as the one Nadia was using.   Right now though anything was better than open comms.    \n\n\nSensing a subtle irritation from Iyola.  He could understand she was isolated, somewhat, within a Mandalorian clan.   Despite being Mandalorian himself he didn’t feel out of place but he didn’t make any assumptions that he wasn’t an outsider here as well.  While he was Mandalorian he was from a different clan.  Trust and friendships took time to build.\n\n\nNow that Nadia had gone back to full ‘work mode’ so to speak they waited for the airlock to cycle.  When the green indicator light flashed green he moved forward to lead the way in.   Eve’s greeting was becoming a welcome thing which he found surprisingly odd.  \n\n\n**”Acknowledge Eve.  The technical team will be giving you a once over.   We know you need some repairs.  Clan Skirata technicians will be helping with that.  Give them,”**. He paused for a second to think.  **”Technical crew level access to the areas that they need.  If they need help you have my authorization to answer what question you can and if it requires my intervention for clearance let me know.”**   \n\n\nHe stepped back and to the side and looked at that first technician.  His voice echoed out from his vocoder, clear and calm.  **”State your name.  Eve will be required to scan you and for your access to the *Venture*.  She is an interactive AI. You can talk and ask questions to her as you would anyone else.  She knows herself and the ship better than anyone.  If there are questions, have her reach out to me.”**\n\n\nHe looked over to Nadia and gave her a small nod.   **”Should be enough to get them started.”**\n***",

The rhythmic tapping of Varda\u0027s staff continues, a soft counterpoint to the distant hum of the ship\u0027s systems. \n\nA moment later, Misha\u0027s small figure appears in the archway separating the galley and lounge. She pauses, taking in the quiet scene, then gravitates towards the molecular synthesizer on the galley counter, a flicker of professional interest in her eyes. The sheer quality and capabilities of the equipment are a stark contrast to the jury-rigged systems of the *Aether*, offering a welcome distraction from the overwhelming emotional turbulence.",

However, access to those logs, or to provide real-time monitoring of specific individuals, is subject to prevailing crew commands and security protocols, or higher authority.\"**\n\nA fractional pause, then her voice shifts, taking on a subtle, analytical cadence as Iyola holds up the enigmatic device. **\"Processing visual and resonant data. Initial analysis indicates the object is a \u0027Nanite Swarm Controller\u0027, model designation \u0027Wrangler-Series Maintenance Tool.\u0027 It is an indigenous component of the *Venture\u0027s* original provisioning, designed for localized control and deployment of self-repair nanite swarms for hull and system integrity.\"**\n\nEve\u0027s voice then addresses the second part of Iyola\u0027s question. **\"Its operational functionality is linked directly to the *Venture\u0027s* central power grid and integrated nanite deployment systems. It draws power and commands nanite swarms remotely when within range of the ship\u0027s active network. Its inert status outside the vessel\u0027s operational field is consistent with its design. To \u0027power it up,\u0027 you need only activate it within the *Venture\u0027s* energized field. Its activation sequence is an intuitive, bio-responsive interface, designed to resonate with basic tactile commands from a designated user. A press on the central crystalline emitter should suffice.\"**",

Optimal functionality would occur within a primary engineering junction or a heavy equipment bay where residual nanite swarms are most concentrated. However, activating dormant nanites is not an autonomous process. The tool itself is merely a controller.\"**\n\n**\"The nanites themselves do not possess sapience,\"** Eve continues, her voice perfectly calm. **\"They respond to precise command parameters. You, as the operator, would need to issue a specific directive: \u0027deconstruct,\u0027 \u0027construct\u0027 (specifying form), or \u0027bond\u0027 (specifying materials and connection points). Success would depend on your comprehension of the desired function and your technical aptitude for utilizing the tool. My systems can provide technical schematics and instructionals, should you require them.\"**",

Are things always this busy?”** \n\n\nHe didn’t get an answer right away as Nadia was quick to give Vekka orders.   One of which was dealing with Grist.   As Eve mentioned that the pirates\u0027 current state his cooperation was probable.  He had a gut feeling that the assumption would change when the pirate saw who was going to be taking him.  **”Eve. The security detail has authorization to request he be drugged if he resists.”**   He looked back at Nadia.  **”Hopefully that will cover the major things the team has ahead.”**\n\n\nOnce things were taken care of Wes sent a message to Iyola.  **”All set here for now.   Are you still hungry?”**  Despite it still being early he wanted a good sleep. He had a feeling that on the *Oya’ka* he’d finally get some good rest after he sent the info about Marina and Master Davion on to Nadia.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet on [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

Keep an eye on our guests.  I don’t expect any funny business but one can’t be too cautious.  Send me a message every hour with an update.

She wondered if other crew members got the same veiled lectures.  *Probably not Wes. Eve liked Wes.*\n\n**“Thanks, Eve,” **she said, tucking the device away.  She’d done her share of mucking around and kludging things together, but something told her that an academy-trained mechanic like Misha would be better-suited to run a swarm of nanites to repair the ship.  Then again, when had something like that stopped her before?\n\n**“So are the nanites just outside the ship, or are they inside the Venture with us, like, right now?”**\n\nIyola headed back to the Mandalorian ship, the Atin Oya’ka, a pillow tucked away in her backpack.",

Knowing that Iyola was on the way he set about pulling out the food that Iyola had out before.   Something quick, easy and tasty was needed and deserved by all of them.\n\n\nAs he got things ready he was going over the details he would write up for Nadia.  He hoped that her uncle’s contacts were as good and far reaching as she implied.   If Marina was still out there he sincerely hoped he could find her.  The fact that he couldn’t sense her was a chilling reality.   If this was what she felt when he went into cryo and to have it last for nine years.   Not knowing what happened to him, he couldn’t imagine.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

She\u0027s tracing the faded, almost calligraphic script of an old war chronicle when the doors to the galley hiss open again.\n\nShe looks up as Iyola enters, followed by Wes. The casual, almost desperate way Iyola takes a swig of ale, then Wes\u0027s weary agreement, resonates deeply. The atmosphere in the galley is already shifting from apprehension to a tired camaraderie, and the aroma of brewing caf mingles with the promise of actual food.\n\nMisha sets the heavy book down, the soft thump echoing in the comfortable space. She makes her way towards the galley, her shoulders still a little hunched, but the overt nervousness seems to have receded, replaced by a cautious, almost hopeful, curiosity.\n\n**\"Oh, good. You\u0027re back,\"** Misha says, her voice still quiet but without its earlier tremor. She glances at Iyola\u0027s flask, then to the various food items Wes is pulling out. **\"It definitely feels like a long day. Even without... you know. But this ship is actually... really nice. And they have *real* caf.\"** She picks up a mug and walks over to the caf machine, pouring herself another steaming cup.\n\nShe listens intently as Wes speaks of caution and updates from Eve. A flicker of her technical academy training surfaces. **\"That makes sense,\"** Misha says, nodding slowly. **\"Keeping a close eye on new systems. And Eve. She\u0027s... definitely unique. Very protocol-driven.\"** She offers a small, almost shy, smile. **\"So... what are we cooking?\"** Her practical side is eager for a task, for something she can understand and contribute to.",

Even the academy archives don\u0027t go that far back in detail.\"** She shakes her head slowly, looking from the ancient book to Iyola\u0027s eager face. **\"Yes. Please. I...

        "content":  "As Iyola carefully turns the brittle, heavy pages of the ancient Mandalorian book, its flimsiplast binding crackles softly. The intricate Mando\u0027a script, both sharp and flowing, covers every available surface, punctuated by breathtaking, full-page illustrations in vibrant, if slightly faded, colors. These aren\u0027t dry historical records; they are heroic sagas, depicted with a raw, visceral energy.\n\n||The book seems to center on the Mandalorian Wars, an era far removed even from Iyola\u0027s time. One particular sequence of illustrations catches the eye. The vivid art depicts the towering, armored figures of Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, their distinctive mask designs (some with terrifying, elongated T-visors, others with fierce, animalistic visages) rendered in stunning detail. They are shown sweeping across star systems, their massive warships—a stark contrast to modern designs—raining fire upon planetary surfaces. The script speaks of glorious conquests, of a martial ideal fulfilled, of an unyielding *resol\u0027nare*.\n\nThen the imagery shifts dramatically. One set of pages, stained and slightly faded more than the others, depicts a terrible, apocalyptic landscape. The sky is torn, the ground shattered. In the center, a lone, robed figure stands amidst the devastation. The accompanying Mando\u0027a text speaks of Malachor V, of \"darkness consuming light and shadow,\" and of a \"weapon that unmade all things.\" The imagery is both horrific and strangely compelling, showcasing not just the Mandalorians\u0027 prowess in war, but the catastrophic, almost mythical, forces unleashed in its wake. The text hints at a turning point, a profound, irreversible shift in the history of both the Mandalorians and the wider galaxy, a pivotal moment from an age long, long forgotten by most. It\u0027s clear that this isn\u0027t just history; it\u0027s the very foundation of Mandalorian identity and lore, preserved through saga and battle-song.||",

Names were mentioned and he stopped prepping the meal to listen.  Childhood memories came back as he recollected a simpler time.   Varda could sense the emotions.  It was indeed a dark time in Mandalorian history.  \n\n\n**”Malachor V was the final battle of the Mandalorian wars.  Jedi forces and Mandalorians fought a bloody, disastrous battle.  Massive armies and fleets were lost on both sides.  A Jedi General named Revan slew Mandalore the Ultimate  in battle.”**  His voice was soft as he spoke.   Memories of history lessons coming back.   **”Depending on who wrote the history one side or the other were made out to be the aggressors.   History has a way of being written by the winner.  Like we’ve seen the Empire do now.”**\n\n\nHe paused for a second as he shifted his weight and set the knife he was holding down.   **”I don’t know how, or if any one in our time does, but Malachor V was devastated by some sort of weapon.  Rumors and suspicion was that a Jedi created it but it was so long ago.  It supposedly killed almost every combatant on and above Malachor V.  Mandalorian, Jedi and Republic soldier alike.”** He let out a sigh as thinking that things maybe hadn’t changed so much in the thousands of years since.  \n\n\n**”That book is a piece of history.”**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

For a moment she studies Misha, gaze assessing but not unkind, before she nods faintly to herself, as if some private conclusion has been reached. The knife begins its slow, deliberate dance over the grain, small curls of wood falling away as a shape starts to emerge. \"**To put it in the way I know best,**\" she says softly, \"**I feel as though I am a tree without roots, old and ancient, but now displaced. I fear I may not take root again… though perhaps...**\" her mouth quirks faintly, \"**it’s too early to tell.**\"",

It\u0027s a terrifying, exhilarating, utterly overwhelming concept. She\u0027s never considered it before. The thought that she could choose her *own* path, be a \"scholar of ancient texts\" or even a \"resistance fighter\", it plants a seed of rebellious possibility in her mind, a faint, almost forbidden thrill.\n\nThen Varda squints at the walls, and Misha, startled, glances nervously around the room, as if expecting listening devices to suddenly activate. The image of the \"old crone muttering portents\" makes her manage a shaky, surprised laugh, the sound weak but genuine.\n\n**\"Oh. Um. Okay,\"** Misha says, a little breathlessly, still processing the sheer magnitude of Varda\u0027s words. She then nods at the mystery of the carving, a shy smile returning. **\"Alright. I\u0027ll... I\u0027ll wait and see.\"**",

From what she could tell, much of the history of Mandalore involved Mandalorians fighting pretty much everything and everyone, including each other.  It seemed that they spent as much detail recounting their horrific losses as their victories.  \n\nThe Mandalorians in her time had seemingly, for the most part, put that history aside.  *But the past has a way of returning.  The past is never past.  *\n\nShe glances thoughtfully at the alcohol selection, then reconsiders.  **“Going to see what else they have on offer,”** she says, heading to the lounge to look over the reading selections.",

But tucked away, amidst these more imposing tomes, Iyola discovers a small collection of school primers. Written in clear, concise Aurebesh, they cover basic galactic history, planetary geography, and fundamental principles of xenology. Clearly intended for a younger, non-Mandalorian audience, or for young Mandalorians learning Basic. There\u0027s also a smaller collection of well-worn, dog-eared fiction novels, their covers depicting fantastical alien landscapes and heroic, non-Mandalorian figures, some bearing the distinctive stamp of the High Republic\u0027s golden age of popular fiction.",

Buried under a fat tome of a biography of Mand’alor the Uniter, she finds a cache of novels, including a series she recognizes, *The Secret Moon*, featuring an explorer/diplomat/warrior/dancer - the list went on - called Aradara Diorlo.  She’d read up to the sixth volume in the series, but it looked like there were at least three more.  How exciting!  She grabs the seventh, *The Green Veil*, in which it appears that Aradara is undercover on a planet that, if she squints, might be Takodana.  She’ll find out! \n\nShe picks out the first in the series for Misha - it’s called *The Temple Treasure.*\n\nHeading back to the kitchen, she hands it to Misha. “**Here you go, Misha.  It’s in Aurebesh.  Great read.  It’s also kind of a Jedi romance, if you like those.”** Jedi romances featured smoldering looks, forbidden longing, and meaningful symbolic displays of lightsabers, but no actual contact.  As she recalled, Aradara got tired of that pretty quickly.",

He was going to combine that with some ground nerf steak once it was cooked up.   He set two containers of sauce aside to mix it all together with.    Add in some of the spices and soon there would be a childhood meal ready to serve.   \n\n\nWes looked up and let out a small ‘hmmm’ at Iyola’s comment on Jedi romance.  **”There’s nothing wrong with Jedi romance.”**  He said with a wry smile.  **”There’s a lot of emotion there that’s all pent up”**  \n\n\nHe looked down as he stirred the ground nerf meat in the pan.  It sizzled as he moved the utensil around.   Seeing that the water was now boiling he tossed in the rice covering it and removed it from the heat.   Reaching for the spices he added an aromatic blend that had the cabin air giving off a telltale warning of sap ice.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

I really needed something like this.\"** The idea of losing herself in a story, particularly one she could actually *read*, seems to wash away some of the oppressive weight of her new reality.\n\nWes\u0027s quiet comment about Jedi romance, and the \"pent-up emotion,\" makes Misha blush faintly. She glances at him, then quickly down at the book in her hands, a shy, almost conspiratorial smile playing on her lips. **\"Pent-up emotions can be... complicated,\"** she murmurs, mostly to herself, but with a subtle nod to the wisdom in his words.\n\nThe sizzling of the nerf meat, the fragrant steam from the rice, and the exotic blend of spices fill the galley, replacing the smell of caf with a comforting, almost nostalgic warmth. Misha takes a deep breath, letting the delicious aromas calm her further. She clutches the book to her chest, a small, tangible anchor of normalcy in the midst of her profoundly abnormal existence. Her genuine excitement over the novel is palpable, a clear indication of her desperate need for escapism and connection. She finds a clean spot on the counter and quietly sets the book down, still keeping it close as she turns her attention back to the bustling activity in the galley.",

Pent up emotions was just one of many but those emotions were strong and powerful.  Emotions that kept him going for years after the Purge.   A silent hope that things would work out and they would be together again.  Considering that it’s now been almost twenty years that reality seems even farther away.   Add in the fact that he couldn’t feel her presence in the Force seemed to cement it even more.  It was a somber feeling that he feared he may have to come to terms with.   \n\n\nAny who may have been watching saw him let out a small sigh as he drained off some of the fat from the nerf meat before setting the steaming pan to the side.  Checking on the rice brought forth a small nod at his satisfaction that it was just about done.   \n\n\nSoon the sauce was added into the ground nerf meat and brought to a slow bubble.   Then the rice was folded into the meat and sauce where it was slowly mixed under low heat.

I dated - well, not sure dated is the right word, but anyway - I was involved with a Jedi when I was in the joint program on Vinee.   I wasn’t the only one either.  It’s just about the level of attachment, right?  That was before I met Caz, of course.”  **\n\n**“I didn’t look that hard, but the series might be missing *Pathway to Peril*,”**  she advised Misha.  **“I can recap it for you if you get that far along.”**\n\nTo Wes, she says, **“I didn’t see any butter, but there’s some quickbread in the cooler.  Just add water.” **",

Such frankness, such ease with personal history, is utterly alien to her carefully constructed Imperial background. She glances at Wes, then back at Iyola, a mixture of awe and profound bewilderment on her face. *Dated a Jedi?* The concept alone feels like high treason.\n\n**\"Oh. Um. That\u0027s... that\u0027s very kind of you, Iyola,\"** Misha says, clutching the book in her hands. The thought of needing a recap for an earlier volume adds another layer of delightful normalcy to the overwhelming events of the day.\n\nShe then turns her attention back to the bustling activity at the stove as Wes asks about bread and butter. **\"No butter, Wes, but Iyola\u0027s right,\"** Misha confirms, her voice regaining some of its technical clarity. **\"The quickbread is in the cold locker, just above the nutrient bars. It activates with a small amount of water. I can... I can get it.\"** She takes a tentative step towards the cooler, grateful for the practical task. The rich, savory aroma of the simmering nerf and rice, now mingled with Iyola\u0027s spicy ale, is making her stomach growl with an almost embarrassing fervor.",

Thanks Misha.”**  He went back to stirring the combined ingredients and then set the heat to simmer while they waited for the quick read.   \n\n\nHe looked up at everyone.  They all seemed to be settling in.   The fervor of waking up, the rescue and the escape to a safe harbor was winding down.   They would surely all sleep well after a good hot meal.   Iyola’s words were rattling around in his head.  Attachment was a big no with the Jedi Order but that didn’t mean things didn’t happen.  What happened between Marina and himself no one saw coming.   The bond that formed had never been seen.  It was special and it was also a cause for the Order to keep them apart.  He had mostly come to terms with it in time.  Recent events and now not sensing her was eating at him.

As he looked around the table Wes saw that all ate with a need.  The smell of a home cooked meal was something he always looked forward to.  He knew what it was like to eat rations for extended periods and anything resembling cooked food was always looked upon with anticipation.  \n\n\nWhen things wound down and Misha offered to clear the table he gave the young woman a nod and sat back.  His gaze fell upon the porthole as the sun dipped down behind the horizon.  The day was coming to an end and Wes felt like he could perhaps get some good sleep.  \n\n\nIt wasn’t long after that the dishes were finally all cleared and taken care of. Wes gave Misha a nod of thanks, said good night to the others and made his way off to the quarters he had claimed.  Once inside he removed his armor.  And neatly placed it on the second bunk.  Spotting a towel he grabbed it and made way to the passenger shower that was just beyond his own cabin.  \n\n\nTwenty minutes later he was back in his cabin.  Dried off and wearing a pair of clean shorts.  He wanted to sleep but remembered that he needed to get the info about Marina and Master Davion prepped to send to Nadia.  Picking up his left vambrace and strapped the piece of armor over his forearm while activating the bracer computer.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

Satisfied he tapped the send icon and his message was off to Marina.  He hoped she would send it on to Ghurn without much delay.  Feeling that sleep was going to be easy to find, he removed the armor piece from his forearm and placed it with the rest of his armor.  \n\n\nWith a quick and easy movement he made his way to the other bunk pulling the blanket aside he laid down his head hitting the soft pillow.  The last two days ran through his mind as he yawned.  It almost felt like a dream.  The last thing he remembered before falling asleep was how Nadia’s eyes still poked at the back of his brain.  As if he should recognize them.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

She wondered who else had slept in this little alcove. She’d have to search the room tomorrow.\n\nIyola started to read  *The Green Veil*, but was suddenly so tired that she face-planted into the text, plummeting into a deep sleep.",

The silence of the night has given way to the hum of ship systems and the inviting aroma of freshly brewed caf from the industrial-strength machine. A selection of pre-packaged Mandalorian breakfast rations – nutrient-dense bars, dried fruits, and small containers of flavored synth-porridge – are laid out on the central table, evidence someone had gone through the trouble of laying out a breakfast. The private hangar bay outside is quiet, save for the rhythmical movement of automated cleaning droids and the occasional clang of maintenance protocols running on the docked vessels.\n\nOne by one, the crew of the *Venture* gathers in the galley. Vaeros and Dryzan are already seated, each with a steaming mug of caf, Vaeros lost in contemplation of the datacron he\u0027s brought with him, Dryzan casually munching on a ration bar while scanning the datapad he found the night before. Misha enters, her eyes still heavy with sleep, and makes a beeline for the caf machine, filling a large mug with grateful relief.",

It bears a bird’s proud, triangular face and wide, arched wings, its chest marked with faint striations that shimmer like leaves caught in sunlight. She inspects her work, then nods in quiet satisfaction before holding it out to Misha. \"**We call this, in my clan, the Winged Goddess. The one who gives dreams, a bastion against the dark,**\" Varda says softly. \"**I can see the mark upon your light, the harm that wretched ship did to you. Take heart in this when you need it. Think of that feeling of choice and let it guide you when you need.**\"",

The griffin-like figure seems almost alive, its carved feathers shimmering as if touched by an inner light. When Varda holds it out, Misha reaches for it with both hands, cradling the small wooden idol as if it were spun from fragile starlight.\n\n**\"It\u0027s... it\u0027s beautiful,\"** Misha whispers, her voice filled with a genuine awe she rarely displays. Her fingers trace the faint striations on its chest, feeling the smooth, cool wood. The meaning, the intention behind the gift, lands with a profound impact, softening the edges of her fear. Varda\u0027s words resonate deep within her, planting a seed of defiant hope.\n\n**\"Thank you, Varda,\"** Misha says, her gaze meeting the Dathomiri\u0027s. This time, her smile is not shy or hesitant, but quiet and deeply sincere. **\"I... I will. I promise.\"** She carefully places the carving in her pocket, a small, comforting weight.\n\nMisha, clutching the Winged Goddess, rises from the table. She offers Varda a final, grateful nod, then, with a newfound sense of purpose, heads towards the passenger cabin assigned to her. The door hisses shut behind her.\n\nReturning to the common area, a tentative strength blooming in her demeanor, Misha walks over to the dusty rack of old datapads and holobooks tucked into an alcove in the lounge. Her hands, no longer trembling, reach out to explore the forgotten shelves.",

Hours after leaving the hangar, long after the last of Vekka\u0027s initial diagnostics were reported to her datapad, she remains restless in the quarters she now occupies. She has shed her heavy Mandalorian armor, the plates carefully laid out in the small room. In its place, she wears a long, worn duster over more casual shirt and pants that she wears with the same ease as her armor. She moves with a restless energy, gathering a discreet utility belt, checking a concealed blaster at her hip. She taps a new pair of local credits into a pouch, her face grim. The need to act, to do something tangible, to move, burns within her. The quiet comfort of the quarters is a stark prison against the storm raging in her mind.\n\nNadia moves towards the galley, her mind already set on a discreet journey to a more secluded location on Cloud City. She needs solitude. She needs to think. She needs... to escape.\n\nAs she enters the galley, her movements still driven by that cold, desperate need for action, she finds Varda. The old Dathomiri witch sits at the large durasteel table, bathed in the soft glow of the molecular synthesizer, her weathered hands still meticulously working.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e on [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Notable-Allies#nadia-skirata\u003e)",

Groaning, he let his legs hang over the side of the bunk and hopped down off the mattress.  His feet landed on the solid decking.   As he stretched one more time he thought he could smell caf.  Grabbing a grey Tshirt he threw it on to compliment the black shorts he already wore.  \n\n\nOpening the door to the cabin the full assault of the brewed caf hit his senses and a small “Mmmm” escaped as he put one foot in front of the other.   Entering the galley he spotted Vaeros, Dryzan and Misha all enjoying some breakfast.   Seeing Misha near the caf machine he figured she had the same thought as he did.  **”Did you smell the caf as well?”**  He looked over the  other items that had been laid out wondering if it was Nadia who went through the trouble to prep all this.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

Her blue eyes narrow, assessing the scene: the Dathomiri, the cards splayed on the table, the precise, knowing question. A wave of irritation, sharp and immediate, mixes with a jolt of alarm.\n\nShe steps fully into the galley, her expression carefully neutral, though a faint tension in her jaw betrays her discomfort. Her gaze sweeps over the cards—\"The Seer,\" \"The Vessel,\" \"The Path,\" and then the darker, almost menacing \"Whisper.\" \n\n**\"Good evening, Varda,\"** Nadia replies, her voice low and carefully even, betraying nothing. She walks to the opposite side of the table, putting distance between herself and the cards, her arms crossing over her chest. **\"And you. It seems neither of us finds much peace this night.\"**",

Varda\u0027s words, gentle and reassuring, cut through the tension, but the appearance of the new card, \"Death,\" sends a cold, unexpected ripple of unease through her.\n\nHer blue eyes fix on the card, then snap back to Varda\u0027s face, a flicker of genuine alarm piercing her carefully constructed neutrality. The unspoken threat, or perhaps warning, is chilling.\n\n**\"What... is this?\"** Nadia asks, her voice dropping to a near-whisper, an edge of command masked by barely controlled apprehension. She doesn\u0027t gesture, doesn\u0027t move. All her attention is fixed on Varda, on the unsettling card. **\"What do you want, Varda?\"**",

She buttons her cloak a little tighter, the quiet click of each fastening marking her measured composure. With gentle swiftness, she clears the table, each movement deliberate, ritualistic.\n\n\"**Death in these cards can mean many things,**\" she continues, her tone calm, assured. \"**Transformation. Change. New beginnings. Much like the Force itself. When one passes, they do not end, they move on, to the spirit realm.**\"\n\nHer eyes soften as she regards the dark card. \"**This one was not in its usual place tonight,  it found me. So, Nadia Skirata, you have nothing to fear from it. I believe that mantle is mine to bear.**\"\n\nWith a quiet snap of her posture, she straightens, the air around her shifting from introspection to purpose. \"**I wish to leave the compound for a moment or two. Would you lead me out? Hm. I believe the night air would do you some good as well. away from this gilded cage that surrounds us, aye?**\"",

The Dathomiri\u0027s quiet reassurances, her philosophical interpretation of \"Death,\" do little to quell the cold knot of unease in Nadia\u0027s gut. The words \"mantle is mine to bear\" carry a profound, heavy weight, resonating with a truth Nadia does not wish to confront. She forces herself to take a deep, slow breath, trying to dispel the phantom chill the card has left.\n\nVarda\u0027s abrupt shift to purpose, the request to leave the compound, catches Nadia off guard. She stares, trying to reconcile the mystic with the demand, the wisdom with the startling immediacy of the request. \"Gilded cage.\" The words prick at her, echoing the subtle confinement she already feels.\n\n**\"Leave... the compound?\"** Nadia repeats, her voice still a low whisper, incredulity warring with a sudden, sharp interest. Her gaze darts to the closed galley door, then back to Varda. The thought of stepping outside, of feeling the true Bespin air, even the city\u0027s filtered night air, is a temptation that cuts through her immediate anxiety. The strategic part of her mind, however, immediately flags the risks. Ghurn\u0027s security, her own uncertain status, the unknowns of Cloud City...\n\nShe hesitates for another long moment, the internal struggle visible only in the faint tension around her eyes. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, she uncrosses her arms. Her shoulders square.\n\n**\"Very well, Varda,\"** Nadia states, her voice regaining its low, firm authority, though a faint note of resignation now tinges it. The restlessness that had driven her to seek escape from her own thoughts returns, now with a tangible target. **\"I will lead you out. But it will be discreet. And you will follow my lead implicitly. We do not attract attention.\"** She nods towards the door, already planning their exit.",

        "content":  "Varda’s smile is almost imperceptible, the faintest upturn of her lips, so restrained it could easily be mistaken for a shadow of thought rather than expression. Yet there is a quiet certainty in it, as though another piece of a much larger design has just fallen neatly into place. It is impossible to tell if this is her natural resting face or a deliberate mask she wears to lull, to comfort, or to observe. With Varda, intent and instinct blur until they are one and the same. \"**Aye,**\" she murmurs, her tone soft but threaded with that strange, undeniable queer hum that seems to sit beneath her every word. \"**I understand. Lead the path, my dear.**\"\n\nShe does not rise immediately, instead allowing the silence to stretch a moment longer, savouring it. The air between them feels heavy, charged not with the electric tension of conflict, but the quiet gravity of two different worlds orbiting closer than they should. When she finally moves, it is with measured grace, the tip of her staff whispering softly against the floor.\n\nHer gaze remains on Nadia, unwavering and unnervingly perceptive. She studies every motion, every breath, every flicker of uncertainty that dares to cross the young woman’s face. Each movement is noted,  catalogued with the same methodical care she might apply to deciphering an ancient sigil. The subtle quirk of an eyebrow, the tightening of her jaw, the faint narrowing of her eyes when she thinks too long all of it feeds into the witch’s quiet understanding. Varda does not see merely the physical; she reads the ripples beneath the surface, the echo of emotion that clings to every gesture. Fear. Duty. Defiance. Each is there, woven in delicate threads that Nadia herself may not yet see.",

Varda follows, her staff tapping softly, matching Nadia\u0027s pace without apparent effort, her own presence a quiet, watchful shadow.\n\nThey step back into the vast, brightly lit expanse of Ghurn\u0027s private hangar bay. The air, crisp and slightly cool, carries faint echoes of industrial hums and distant city traffic. The bay appears empty of other organic life, watched over only by the silent, omnipresent security droids.\n\nNadia doesn\u0027t head for the main hangar doors. Instead, her steps turn towards a discreet maintenance access panel tucked away behind a stack of unused cargo containers. Her fingers move with practiced ease over the obscured keypad, tapping in a complex, almost reflexive sequence. The panel slides open with a faint *whoosh*, revealing a narrow, utilitarian shaft leading down and out. This isn\u0027t an official exit. This is a path known only to those who prefer to enter and exit Ghurn\u0027s compound... unseen. The familiarity with which Nadia navigates this secret route suggests a history of clandestine departures and unnoticed returns. The night air of Cloud City, surprisingly clean and cool, begins to waft up through the opening, beckoning them towards its labyrinthine sprawl.",

Her posture remains tense, focused on the immediate task of egress, but the slight relaxation in her stride hints at the relief of escaping the confines of the *Oya\u0027ka*\u0027s walls. The cool night air of Cloud City, surprisingly invigorating, makes her take a deeper breath, an almost unconscious re-connection with the outside world.\n\nHer ears, accustomed to the subtle acoustics of clandestine movement, catch Varda\u0027s quiet laugh just as they reach the entrance to the outside. Nadia does not turn, but a faint, almost imperceptible shake of her head is the only response, a shared acknowledgement of the subtle triumph.",

This isn\u0027t the public promenade of Cloud City, but a part of its vast, unseen infrastructure.\n\nThe air here is noticeably cooler, carrying a faint, clean scent of filtered oxygen mixed with a distant, metallic tang from the city\u0027s power grid. Recessed glow-panels in the ceiling cast a steady, subdued light, just enough to illuminate the wide, well-maintained tunnel. Thick, armored piping—clearly part of Cloud City\u0027s waste disposal or atmospheric recycling—runs along one wall, occasionally interspersed with large, automated access hatches. The floor is a sturdy, anti-slip grated plasteel, meticulously clean, showing very little foot traffic.\n\nThe tunnel stretches out in a straight line for about fifty meters before curving gently to the left. Further down, at that curve, more automated maintenance entrances can be seen, hinting at a vast, subterranean network of such passages crisscrossing beneath Cloud City\u0027s gleaming surface. Above them, the low rumble of repulsorlift traffic, usually felt as a distant vibration, is now slightly more distinct, hinting at their proximity to a vehicle maintenance level or a less-frequented loading dock. It\u0027s an anonymous, quiet place, ideal for unnoticed entry or exit from the compound, feeling miles away from both the compound and the bustling city proper.",

An abandoned freight access terminal. From there, it\u0027s a short distance to a public tram station. Relatively quiet, at this hour.\"** She glances at Varda, a flicker of something almost akin to genuine curiosity in her blue eyes. **\"Did you have somewhere in particular you wanted to go?\"**",

Somewhere open, where the air can move freely. Or perhaps a garden,**\" she adds after a pause, her tone softening to something wistful, \"**a greenspace kissed by the lights of the sunrise.

A place where the winds of Bespin dance unhindered, a greenspace kissed by the sunrise... the descriptions are almost poetic, far removed from Nadia\u0027s usual tactical assessments. She finds herself momentarily envisioning such a place, a rare escape from her own constant mental fortifications.\n\nThen Varda adds, \"And a suitable place for a burial.\" The casual, somber tone of the words is like a splash of cold water, snapping Nadia back to the grim realities of their task. The mention of burial immediately conjures the image of Derek, and a fresh wave of grief, cold and sharp, washes over her, pushing aside any fleeting aesthetic appreciation.\n\nNadia\u0027s face hardens, her jaw tightening. Her gaze, though still cautious, sharpens with renewed purpose. **\"A place where the clouds fall away and the winds dance unhindered? I know exactly such a place. The West Garden Promenade, on Level 220.\"** Her voice is low, firm, devoid of the earlier trace of wistfulness. **\"It\u0027s high enough. And at this hour, it should be relatively secluded.

Perhaps to put  Nadia or herself at ease. \"**In my coven,**\" she adds softly, \"**we never mourn the passing. We say the force within us dances, first slow, then faster, until it breaks free of flesh and joins the storm. A burial, a farewell… these are not for sorrow. They are the breath before the wind begins again.**\"\n\nShe taps her cane once against the metal floor, a rhythm like an old heartbeat, and looks ahead to the dim-lit path that stretches before them. \"**Hmmm, well it would have been what I would have taught my grandson, when he grew old enough.**\"",

The subtle hum in Varda\u0027s voice, the quiet authority of her acceptance, resonates with Nadia in a way few other interactions do. \n\nThen Varda speaks of her coven, of the Force dancing and breaking free. The philosophy resonates deeply with Nadia\u0027s own understanding, stirring something primal within her. The thought of teaching her grandson... a pang, sharp and unexpected, strikes Nadia, for a moment drawing her out of her warrior\u0027s composure. *Grandson*. The word is loaded with the unspoken grief of a lost lineage. Of lost opportunity.\n\nNadia\u0027s gaze turns to Varda, holding a flicker of deep, personal curiosity. **\"It\u0027s a beautiful philosophy, Varda,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice softer than it has been all night, a genuine admission. **\"To see death as a dance. As joining the storm.\"**\n\nShe then turns her head and her words then drop to a near-whisper, tinged with a raw, undeniable emotion she usually keeps fiercely hidden. **\"My own mother... she used to speak of the Force in similar ways. As a flow, a song... before the Empire started their campaign to wipe out anyone who could hear it.\"** The image of her mother, vibrant and alive, flashes in her mind, then the cold, empty void where her Force presence used to be. The grief is fresh, a raw wound.\n\nNadia straightens her shoulders, her movements becoming sharper, more focused. The personal moment, the emotional bleed-through, is quickly contained. **\"The public tram station is ahead. We maintain discretion. No Force use in public. We will blend in with the normal flow of Cloud City traffic. And we avoid unnecessary attention.\"** The urgency in her voice is back, overriding the emotional turmoil, pulling them both firmly back to the present and the task at hand.",

She pads in on bare feet her hair free and rolling down her back. It\u0027s a strange sight. When garbed and dressed to an inch within her life it hides the frailness of her form. But now in something that has little to no weight to it, it really highlights how old she really is. Regardless of that the very air around he feels lighter. As if a great weight has been lifted from her shoulders. She sweeps round to fill a glass of water before wetting her throat. \"**Merry met.**\" She almost sings, \"**I hope the land of dreams faired us all well. If not**\"\n\nShe pauses and makes a motion with her hand and in Dathomiri proclaims. \"**Atavan mer Bogan**\" \n\nif there are any eyes filled with confusion she continues. \"**A little something to ward of bad spirits. Pesky little things.**\" The woman who walks and talks is almost like a distorted variant of the one from the night before. As if the time for mourning and melancholy has fled from her mind and now she delights in an adventure.",

The Force flares around the Dathomiri, a raw, untamed storm of fury and conviction that echoes the primordial energies of her homeworld. The quiet tunnel seems to thrum with the resonance of Varda\u0027s oath, each word burning with a Force-infused intensity that shakes Nadia to her core. It\u0027s a vow to the very Force itself, a promise of relentless, stubborn survival against an impossible foe. The vision of a muted, silenced galaxy, of a Force unbound, resonates with a truth Nadia has felt in her own heart, even if her pragmatic mind resists its mystical fervor.\n\nThen, as quickly as it ignites, the storm subsides. Varda\u0027s declaration of apology, the admission of personal challenge, draws Nadia back from the brink of overwhelm. The sheer audacity of such an admission, such vulnerability, from a Force user of Varda\u0027s obvious power, leaves Nadia momentarily speechless.\n\nShe takes a slow, deep breath, trying to steady herself, trying to process the raw power and the startling honesty. **\"No... no need to apologize, Varda,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice still a little breathless, her own emotional defenses momentarily lowered by the raw intensity of the display. She looks at Varda with new, re-evaluated eyes, a profound respect dawning within her.\n\n**\"To hide it,\"** Nadia repeats, her voice low and somber, a faint echo of the fear that still gnaws at her own heart. **\"Yes. That will indeed be a challenge. For both of us. But a necessary one. If we are to find that balance, as you say, we must survive to see it.\"** She gives a single, sharp nod, a silent vow of her own. **\"The tram station. We keep moving.\"** Her gaze, though still cautious, is now filled with a renewed sense of purpose, a quiet determination to meet the challenges ahead, even if those challenges involve the universe itself.",

A public tram glides silently to a stop before them, its doors hissing open. It is clean, functional, and already half-filled with an assortment of Ugnaught maintenance crews heading off shift, a few off-world technicians, and a handful of quietly talking citizens, all lost in their own concerns.

But for Nadia, already keenly attuned to such details, it\u0027s a subtle shift in the currents of the city. Her gaze, subtle and quick, flicks to the public comm display, where the scrolling text confirms the audio message. She glances at Varda, a faint, unreadable expression on her face – an unexpected reprieve. The West Garden Promenade, it seems, has just become slightly more private for their purposes.",

The flickering glow of the passing conduits paints her face in soft bands of gold and blue, and for a long while she simply watches the lights blur by. Her expression is composed, but her eyes are alive, seeing more than the moment, she watches people the way they move. How the one ugnaught seems to hold his right side in favour to his left. To the few people who seem to notice the announcment.\n\n\"**Did you feel that just then,**\" she murmurs after the announcement.\"**The shift in air. That was no coincidence, I think. Places like this, they breathe just as we do. The city exhales when the guards move. It knows when to sleep, and when to open its eyes again.**\"\n\nShe leans back, the faintest smile curling her lips as her gaze drifts to the curved glass of the tram wall. Beyond it, the churning clouds of Bespin drift like living storms, painted in muted shades of royal purple \"**A reprieve, just as the winds foretold,**\" she muses softly, half to herself.",

She nods almost imperceptibly at Varda\u0027s final words, acknowledging the insight without fully embracing the mysticism.\n\n**\"A reprieve, perhaps,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice low and even, as the tram begins to slow, signaling their imminent arrival at Level 220. **\"Or perhaps a warning. Either way, it gives us more room to operate.\"** Her gaze sweeps the approaching platform, her focus sharpening.",

        "content":  "The tram glides smoothly into a well-appointed, softly lit platform. The doors hiss open to reveal Level 220, a distinct shift from the utilitarian efficiency of the lower levels. Here, the air is lighter, perfumed with exotic florals and faint, sweet-smelling synth-smoke from a distant cafe. Recessed lighting casts a warm, inviting glow, and the sounds of Cloud City\u0027s nightlife are softened to a polite murmur—the distant strains of a lounge band, the occasional chiming of a casino, and the muted murmur of sophisticated conversation.\n\nThe platform itself is clean, adorned with decorative planters overflowing with lush, bioluminescent flora. Signs, tastefully etched in both Aurebesh and Cloud City\u0027s unique flowing script, point towards the \u0027Casino District,\u0027 \u0027Observation Decks,\u0027 and, in the direction Nadia leads, the \u0027West Garden Promenade.\u0027\n\nAs Nadia leads Varda from the platform and into the main concourse, the true elegance of Level 220 unfolds. The concourse is wide, carpeted in deep pile synth-velvet, and lined with upscale boutiques, high-end art galleries, and exclusive dining establishments, most softly lit and quietly inviting even at this late hour. The clientele consists of well-dressed spacers, corporate types, and tourists, all moving with an air of casual wealth and leisure.\n\nNadia navigates through this genteel bustle with the practiced ease of someone utterly at home in the environment, despite her practical duster contrasting with the fashionable attire around them. A brief, almost imperceptible glance confirms her silent assessment: relatively secluded. The few security droids that might have been visible earlier have been redeployed, and the concourse is less populated than it would be during peak hours, allowing for a comfortable degree of privacy without drawing undue attention.",

It is an expansive public park carved into the very side of Cloud City. Manicured bioluminescent lawns glow with soft internal light, crisscrossed by curving synth-gravel paths. Exotic, hardy plants, many imported from other worlds and acclimatized to Bespin\u0027s unique atmosphere, bloom in vibrant arrays, their petals unfurling in slow, elegant motions. In the center, a tiered fountain bubbles gently, its recycled water reflecting the distant city lights.\n\nThe true majesty, however, is the vista beyond. Here, at the edge of the city\u0027s highest residential layers, the clouds *do* fall away. Above them, a sliver of Bespin\u0027s roiling, star-dusted upper atmosphere is visible—a swirling tapestry of deep purples and oranges, with distant, pinprick stars peeking through. A light, constant breeze, scented with processed ozone and a hint of something fresh and green from the park itself, flows across the promenade, stirring the plants and carrying the faint, muted hum of the distant city.\n\nIt is a place of profound beauty and quiet contemplation, a tranquil oasis in the heart of the bustling metropolis. And in the center of the promenade, near a grouping of graceful, glowing synth-palms, a large, ornate metal bench stands empty, perfectly positioned for observation.",

        "content":  "Varda meanders deeper into the garden, her steps unhurried, her pace measured by thought rather than time. The night air cools against her skin, and a quiet stillness settles over her, not sorrow, not quite, but something older and deeper. Reflection. The kind that feels like standing at the edge of a never ending lake.\n\nWhen they reach a secluded hollow of the promenade, framed by low, glowing flora and a stretch of open sky, Varda stops. The heavens sprawl above her, endless, mercurial, alive with the slow dance of Bespin’s swirling clouds and distant starlight. For a long moment, she simply stares upward, her lips parted as if words might come but none do. Then, softly, she breathes out, \"**Oh, Araden…**\"\n\nHer hand rises to her staff, fingers tracing the cold, worn lines of the beskar bands in reverence. Her voice trembles, and when she speaks again, it carries the ache of centuries. \"**Lyra… my dear.**\" The names fall like offerings. Her throat tightens, her eyes glisten, and though she tries to swallow the emotion down, the tears come anyway. \"**I know the two of you are walking with the ancestors now. But you-**\" her voice cracks, then steadies, \"**you invited me into your clan as deeply as I welcomed you into my coven. I remember the old hovel you called home, the first time I let you feel the Force. I don’t think I’d ever seen you so quiet, my old friend… my brother.**\"\n\nShe dabs at her eyes with a sleeve, but the tears flow freely still. With a resigned, shuddering breath, she lets them fall small, glimmering drops joining the bioluminescent grass below. \"**You were my coven to the end,**\" she murmurs, voice low and resolute. \"**And for that, I will lay you to rest, truly, all these years later.**\"",

        "content":  "Kneeling upon the smooth path, Varda opens her satchel and withdraws three small pouches, each bound with thin cord. She unties one, revealing a fine white dust porcelain, shimmering faintly under the promenade’s gentle light. She smiles, bittersweet. \"**Your favourite mug,**\"  she whispers. \"**You never could part with it.**\"\n\nShe presses a palmful of the dust to her chest, and begins to hum low, resonant, a vibration that ripples through the air like a thread being plucked. That same air she\u0027s been carrying all night reaches a crescendo. The sound deepens into a chant, her voice weaving syllables that have not been heard in a thousand years. The words are alien, fluid, Dathomiri, but older, raw and elemental. Mist begins to coil at her feet, unfurling across the promenade stones. It does not glow with the green of her homeworld, but with a deep, haunting violet, like the last light before true night.\n\nShe exhales, then flicks her wrist and the dust lifts from her palm, carried upward by unseen hands. The violet mist swells and curls, sweeping the porcelain into the sky, scattering it among the clouds and starlight. Her final words are softer, carried on the wind \"**Live on, my friend, in sky, in sea, in stone, in flame. Death is but the dream we all must wake from.**\"",

For a long moment, she simply breathes, her chest rising and falling as if the rhythm of her own heartbeat has become part of the ritual itself. Then she exhales a shaky laugh, brittle and wet with emotion. \"**Lyra…**\" The name cuts the silence like a memory brought too suddenly to life. \"**The world was right for you to be born on some small, outer rim world.**\" Her tone trembles between anger and fierce love. \"**I fear what you could have accomplished had you ever been given the resources.\"**\n\nShe kneels again, her fingers fumbling slightly as she unties the second pouch. Pale dust spills into her palm, the fine grains catching the violet glow of the mist that still clings to the garden floor. Her voice steadies as she repeats, a soft benediction against the storm of her grief\n\"**Death is but the dream we all must wake from.**\"\n\nWith a whisper of motion, she opens her hand and the mist rises to greet it coiling and curling in intricate ribbons. The particles lift, twining upward until they shimmer like a constellation being born. The violet vapour dances higher, folding and unfurling until, in the dim light, two faint figures seem to take shape: Araden and Lyra, walking hand in hand into the distance, fading into the horizon of her mind’s eye.",

Her voice breaks entirely, and what leaves her throat are no longer words but raw, uncontrolled sobs. The pouch slips open, spilling its contents into her shaking palm. When she can finally speak, her words come as a broken prayer. \"**Lyrus… my star, my heart… my little cloud.**\" She presses the dust to her chest, fingers trembling. \"**The world is cruel. I can only wish to meet you in the spirit world, my dear.**\"\n\nShe releases the final handful into the waiting air. The mist answers. It rises in a last great swell of violet, luminous and slow, curling like incense smoke toward the heavens. For a heartbeat, the spectral shapes of Lyra and Araden turn within it smiling softly as a small, bright figure runs to them. Araden bends, sweeping the boy up into his arms, and together, the three walk forward into the infinite night until the clouds reclaim them. Only the lingering shimmer of purple remains, drifting like stars across the garden’s still air.",

The air crackles with Varda\u0027s raw power, a primeval Force-sense that makes Nadia\u0027s skin prickle. The Dathomiri chant, ancient and alien, resonates deep within her, stirring something buried, something wild and untamed she struggles to keep locked away. The violet mist that unfurls from Varda\u0027s hand is terrifying and beautiful, a potent display of command over life and death. The vision of Araden and Lyra fading into the misty constellations brings an unexpected ache to Nadia\u0027s chest, a profound sense of what it truly means to be lost to time.\n\nBut as Varda delves further into her grief and ritual, Nadia\u0027s Mandalorian discipline reasserts itself. This is Varda\u0027s sorrow, Varda\u0027s ritual, Varda\u0027s path. Nadia\u0027s place is to observe, to guard. To let the old woman grieve in her own way, under the silent witness of the vast Bespin sky.\n\nNadia turns and walks away from the ritual, her steps slow and deliberate, her gaze distant. She moves to a secluded patch of the glowing synth-lawn, its soft, resilient blades yielding beneath her weight. Without preamble, she stretches out on her back, hands clasped behind her head, staring up at the infinite, swirling tapestry of Bespin\u0027s upper atmosphere.",

Nadia closes her eyes, then opens them again, focusing on the slow, majestic drift of the colored clouds. Her mind, usually a fortress of pragmatic calculation and tactical analysis, feels suddenly vast, vulnerable, and overwhelmed.\n\nThe names of the dead replay in her thoughts: Derek. Marina. Araden. Lyra. Lyrus. People lost to time, to violence, to forces beyond understanding. The complexity of it all, the sheer weight of generations of secrets and sacrifices, threatens to drown her.\n\nShe feels the Force around her, not as the contained river her mother spoke of, but as a vast, indifferent ocean, filled with a cacophony of echoes and forgotten songs. The quiet of the West Garden Promenade, the immensity of the sky, should bring peace, but instead, it amplifies the silent, screaming chaos in her own heart. She lays there, still and unmoving, a small, dark figure against the luminous lawn, lost in a storm of impossible truths and unbidden grief, utterly, profoundly alone. This is where Varda would find her, if she chooses to seek her out—a young woman grappling with a reality far grander and crueler than she had ever imagined.",

The sounds seem too loud for the stillness of the promenade as though even the night holds its breath to listen. For a time, she says nothing. Only the gentle hum of the city far below and the soft pulse of the garden lights fill the silence between them.\n\nAt last, she exhales, a sound halfway between a sigh and a growl. \"**Terrifying, isn’t it…**\" Her voice is low, almost swallowed by the night air. \n\"**Showing you that… was callous of me.**\"\n\nAnother pause. She presses her palm into the grass, eyes half-lidded, staring into the distant storm lights that flicker through Bespin’s upper clouds. \"**But it was needed.**\" The words drag from her throat, reluctant and heavy. \"**The Force… life, death, grief, they do not move in straight lines, Nadia Skirata. They spiral, twist, devour, and rebirth. It is an old dance. Older than the stars. Older than even my people remember.**\"\n\nShe turns her head slightly, enough that her gaze catches the side of Nadia’s face  not intrusively, but with the weight of someone trying to see a soul rather than a person. \"**I am sorry it came to you like this,**\" she continues softly. \"**But when our paths crossed, I felt the tides shift. Something vast began to weave between us and I… I meddled. Took precautions. That is what I do.**\" Her voice falters, the admission rasping like sandpaper. \"**I pull the threads. I move the pieces. It keeps the pattern whole.**\"\n\nHer fingers, resting against the grass, curl slightly as though she’s gripping something invisible. \"**But…**\" She stops, shakes her head, and lets out a quiet, bitter laugh. \"**The pattern frays. Speech evades me this night. My wisdom turns to dust on my tongue.**\"",

The Dathomiri\u0027s quiet assessment, her casual affirmation of the terrifying nature of truth, pierces through Nadia\u0027s emotional walls with disarming ease. When Varda speaks of callousness, then necessity, Nadia remains silent, absorbing each word like a fresh blow.\n\nHer muscles tense at the mention of the Force, of life, death, and grief spiraling in an old dance. Varda\u0027s voice, threaded with warmth and ancient wisdom, speaks to something deep within Nadia. Then Varda speaks of meddling, of pulling threads and moving pieces, of trying to keep the \"pattern whole.\" The words resonate with a chilling, undeniable truth, echoing a similar philosophy Nadia herself feels compelled to follow, yet with an unease she cannot place.\n\nNadia slowly turns her head, her face pale and stark against the luminous grass. Her blue eyes, wide and haunted, meet Varda\u0027s. The old woman\u0027s tears, the raw humanity etched onto her ancient face, break through Nadia\u0027s final defenses. The profound empathy that is her strongest, and most painful, Force gift surges through her. She feels Varda\u0027s sorrow, her fear, her immense, desperate burden, all mixed with a strange, undeniable affection for Nadia herself. It is overwhelming, disorienting.\n\nThe offer to \"show instead,\" the soft, tentative plea to offer help, leaves Nadia speechless. The raw honesty of Varda\u0027s self-admitted arrogance, her simple request for permission, is a kindness Nadia had almost forgotten existed.",

Her fingers reach out, hesitant and uncertain, then gently clasp Varda\u0027s, seeking not strength, but simply to bridge the terrifying chasm of their shared and separate truths.\n\n**\"Show me, Varda,\"** Nadia whispers, her voice thick with unshed tears, breaking. It is a surrender, a desperate plea, and a profound act of trust, uttered with the raw, vulnerable honesty of a spirit finally reaching for an anchor in a raging storm.",

Her other hand, still resting upon her staff, tightens faintly, the metal bands humming with a quiet resonance. When she speaks, her voice is low, almost carried by the wind. \"**Then hold fast, child. And do not fear what I show you,  it is not the dark any longer.**\"\n\nThe night around them stills. The whispering leaves fall silent. The low hum of Cloud City fades into something distant and soft, replaced by the murmur of unseen voices and the rhythm of unseen tides. The purple haze that had marked her mourning stirs again, but this time it blooms into colour. Slowly, images begin to unfold between them. Not visions of destiny or battle, but moments small, fragile joys that the galaxy still holds. Children racing through a market on Lothal, laughter echoing between worn stone walls. A mother teaching her daughter to braid ribbons into her hair beneath the trees of Dathomir. A Mandalorian child chasing a tooka across a sunlit courtyard. Hands meeting in trust. Fires shared in silence. Lives continuing. \n\nVarda’s voice, soft and cracked but steady, guides the current. **\"This is also the Force. It is not a storm to break you. It is the breath that keeps the stars burning. Every kindness, every act of love,  it sings in the same current as grief and death. You are not meant to bear it alone.\"**\n\nThe spectral lights drift closer, circling them like fireflies. Their glow touches Nadia’s armour, her face, her hair each shimmer leaving a faint trace of warmth. Varda’s fingers tighten around hers, grounding her. \"**You have felt its cruelty. Now feel its mercy. Its laughter. Its stubborn, radiant will to live.**\"",

Varda\u0027s touch is steady, warm, and the Force that flows between them is gentle, unfamiliar in its profound kindness. The Dathomiri\u0027s words, a soft command to \"hold fast,\" become a lifeline in the overwhelming rush of emotion.\n\nThen, the world transforms. The vast expanse of Bespin\u0027s sky melts away, replaced by ephemeral images that bloom between them like luminous flowers in the mist. Children laughing, a mother\u0027s gentle hands, a Mandalorian child\u0027s joy. These are not grand, cosmic events, but small, precious moments of life, vibrant with a Force Nadia has rarely felt in its pure, unadulterated form. She feels it as a physical sensation—a warmth spreading through her chest, a faint, forgotten whisper of pure joy.\n\nVarda\u0027s voice guides her through the visions, speaking of the Force not as a weapon or a storm, but as breath, as laughter, as love. Each image, each word, is a balm to Nadia\u0027s traumatized soul. The spectral lights touch her, leaving warmth in their wake, and for the first time since her awakening, a fragile sense of peace settles over her, quiet and unexpected.",

The shield she has kept so fiercely around her emotions since her rescue, since Derek\u0027s death—it shatters. A sob, raw and guttural, tears from her throat, quickly followed by another, and another, until her entire body is wracked with uncontrollable, heaving grief. The dam has broken. Tears stream down her face, hot and cleansing, mingling with Varda\u0027s words, washing away weeks of terror, pain, and suppressed sorrow. She squeezes Varda\u0027s hand, clinging to the contact as a drowning person clings to the surface.\n\n**\"My mother... Marina,\"** Nadia chokes out between sobs, the name raw with agonizing love and loss. **\"She was a thread. And she knew... she knew the Force was a song, not a weapon.\"** She pulls her hand from Varda\u0027s, bringing it to her own chest, clenching her fist as if to hold a phantom echo of her mother close.\n\n**\"But it didn\u0027t save her, Varda,\"** Nadia whispers, her voice cracked with despair. **\"It didn\u0027t save Derek. And I... I don\u0027t know how to hear the song anymore. It\u0027s just... static. And secrets. So many secrets.\"** She wraps her arms around herself, curling into a protective ball on the glowing grass, the long, painful sobs continuing to rack her body. The last words are barely audible, swallowed by her profound, heart-wrenching grief. She is utterly broken, a vessel of trauma finally spilling its contents under the merciful night sky.",

Her sleep had been troubled, which was odd, as she could usually sleep anywhere.  *I’m not used to sleeping alone anymore*, she realized.\n\nVarda practically floated into the room, her gray hair free and loose.  She was clearly a morning person.  She uttered an invocation in a language that sounded like Dathomiri to her, before explaining that it was meant to warn off bad spirits.  Iyola was curious despite herself.\n\n**“How do you know there are bad spirits here, Varda?”** Iyola asked.  She took another sip.  She might almost be ready for a slice or two of quickbread.\n\nWes announced that he felt out of place, and Varda concurred, admitting that she missed the *Venture.*  Iyola could understand. As odd as the *Venture* was, it was their ship, their mystery.  She couldn’t help but feel a bit resentful that these Mandalorians were delving into it for their own purposes.  *Should I follow them, see what they’re doing?  Would they resist me? *\n\nTo the two of them, Iyola shrugged.** “I’m used to traveling from place to place.  That’s not odd for me.  What’s odd is spending all this time on ships when I could be on planet.”** She rubbed her eyes and, standing, downed the rest of the caf.",

Hitting the release buttons he detached the bracer computer and made his way back to the galley.   As he entered he activated his comms.  **”Eve, status report.

For a long while, she says nothing, only watches Nadia’s trembling form with the quiet patience of one who has seen countless griefs take root and fade. The wind teases at the ends of her shawl, carrying the faint scent of ozone and lilac from the bioluminescent gardens. Her hand, still faintly trembling from the vision, settles once more over Nadia’s, grounding her.\n\nWhen she finally speaks, her voice is low, almost reverent a melody worn by age and memory. **\"Ah, Nadia… I know,\"** she whispers. **\"The song does not always save. Sometimes it only mourns beside you. Sometimes it sings of what is gone.\"**\n\nShe looks up toward the endless swirl of the upper atmosphere that shimmering canvas of cloud and light that reflects softly in her eyes. \"**But the song is not meant to shield you from pain. It is meant to carry you through it. You hear only static now because you are still standing in the storm.**\" Her thumb brushes gently over Nadia’s knuckles, her smile faint and tremulous. \"**One day, when the wind quiets, you will hear it again, not as your mother did, nor as I do. You will hear your verse in it.**\"\n\nThe Force stirs subtly around them, responding to her words. Small motes of violet light flicker among the grass echoes of the mist that had borne Araden and Lyra away, now soft, harmless, almost playful. They dance between Nadia’s fingers like fireflies before fading back into the soil. Varda draws in a steadying breath, her tone turning warm. Then she leans back on her hands, sighing, the weight of centuries visible in her posture. \"**Grieve, child. Rage, if you must. But do not let the storm teach you only the sound of thunder. There is still music in the world in breath, in laughter, in your own voice.**\"",

It is where we go, after death when we become one with the cosmic flow. Spirits are natural permutations of that unity.**\" \n\nHer gaze softens, distant, as though she’s watching some unseen tide. \"**The Fanged God and the Winged Goddess are the most known among my people, personifications of the dark side and light. But there are others... many others. The Raven Spirit, for one. A witch I once knew could take on its form, so deep was her bond to it. The raven symbolised change.**\" \n\nHer voice lowers, carrying a trace of pride and nostalgia. \"**As for me, I have always favoured the storm. The grey one. Neither light nor dark. Just... the breath between.**\"",

Her sobs rack her body, raw and uncontrolled, each tremor shaking loose another fragment of the trauma and buried pain she has held captive for so long. Varda\u0027s words, gentle and wise, are like a healing balm, slowly working their way through the shattered pieces of Nadia\u0027s soul.\n\nWhen Varda speaks of her mother, of the Force, the song, and the storm, Nadia\u0027s mind, however fragmented, absorbs the wisdom. The faint, violet motes of light dancing around them, the gentle warmth in Varda\u0027s hand, they are tiny reminders of the beauty Varda promises still exists, even beneath the crushing weight of sorrow.\n\nNadia sobs, her head bowing, her body curled into a tight, vulnerable ball on the synth-lawn. She allows Varda\u0027s words to wash over her, a desperate thirst quenching long-parched emotions. The Force, the universe, life, death—it all feels too vast, too overwhelming, but Varda is here, a small, stubborn lighthouse in the infinite dark.\n\nShe pushes her forehead into the cool, glowing grass, seeking a tangible connection, a way to ground herself. The names of her mother and Derek replay in her mind, not as echoes of agony, but as beloved, cherished memories, tinged with an unbearable ache.",

It is not an attempt to erase the pain, but to remind her of the insistent, resilient rhythm of life that still beats within her. A small tremor, different from the sobs, runs through Nadia. It is a slow, almost imperceptible surge of new strength, a faint, undeniable echo of the defiant life force that still courses through her veins.\n\nShe remains silent for a long moment, simply breathing, allowing the raw grief to slowly recede, like a tide pulling back from a battered shore. The sobs lessen, replaced by a deep, shuddering breath, then another, until the only sound is the quiet hum of Cloud City and the soft rustling of the bioluminescent plants.\n\nFinally, Nadia slowly uncurls herself from her protective ball. She lifts her head, her face still tear-streaked and swollen, but her blue eyes, though weary, are now clear and hold a quiet, fierce resolve. She turns her head to Varda, a profound, unspoken gratitude shining from their depths.\n\n**\"My mother... and Derek,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice raw, but steady. **\"They would have wanted me to live. And I will, Varda. I will. For them.\"** She closes her eyes, a single, last tear tracing a path down her cheek. The phrase \"life continues\" settles deep into her heart, a new, fragile anchor in the depths of her soul. She takes a long, shuddering breath, then opens her eyes, their blue gaze now fixed on the swirling clouds of Bespin, not with despair, but with a quiet, fierce determination.",

The old witch’s touch is patient, her breathing slow and deliberate, matching the rhythm of the city’s quiet pulse. She does not rush the girl, nor fill the silence with words; instead, she lets the moment unfold like a slow exhale after a long-held breath.\n\nWhen she finally speaks, her voice is a low murmur, \"**Come, The sun will rise soon. And though the day will not heal what was lost, it will remind you that light returns**\"\n\nNadia nods again, slowly pushing herself upright. Her legs are unsteady, but Varda’s hand finds her shoulder, steady and sure. Together, they stand beneath the drifting clouds, the Force quietly weaving between them two small figures wrapped in the vast, endless rhythm of life continuing. \n\nAs they walk the winding paths of the garden, Bespin’s dawn light filters through the mist, catching on the drifting motes that follow in their wake. Varda’s eyes glimmer with a soft ember of amusement, a faint smile curling at the corner of her lips.\n\n\"**...And these secrets you speak of, child.**\" Her voice lilts with teasing warmth. \"**Let me tell you, not much stays buried when an old witch comes sniffing about.**\" A quiet chuckle escapes her, more like the rustle of dry leaves than laughter. \"**So then, what shadows linger in that mind of yours? Let us see if a little light might make them less fearsome.**\"",

As she pushes herself upright, her legs threaten to buckle, but Varda\u0027s steadying hand on her shoulder is a reassuring anchor, holding her in place. Together, they rise, two figures, one ancient, one young, but both standing renewed in the quiet dawn.\n\nAs they walk, the filtered light of Bespin\u0027s dawn catches on Nadia\u0027s tear-streaked face. The profound, heartbreaking grief still lingers, a raw ache in her chest, but beneath it, a quiet strength is slowly rebuilding. When Varda speaks of secrets, her voice lilting with a mischievous warmth, Nadia\u0027s shoulders subtly stiffen. The old witch\u0027s words, so perfectly timed, so unnervingly perceptive, prick at the deepest, most carefully guarded corners of Nadia\u0027s mind. The laughter that escapes Varda is like the rustle of dry leaves, and it stirs a tremor of both apprehension and reluctant amusement in Nadia.\n\nNadia hesitates. Yet, Varda\u0027s unwavering presence, her open heart, and the profound, shared moment of grief and healing they just experienced, creates a breach in Nadia\u0027s defenses. With a deep, shuddering breath, Nadia draws the datapad from her duster. Her fingers, still trembling slightly, tap a sequence of commands on its surface. The screen flickers to life, displaying a single, encrypted file. She doesn\u0027t speak. She simply holds the datapad out to Varda, a silent, profound act of trust that is far more vulnerable than any confession.",

A glowing neon sign, \"Legs Akimbo,\" casts a lurid red hue across a smiling young woman and a stern Mandalorian. The woman, no older than Nadia, is undeniably striking—her dark brown hair falls in soft waves, framing a face alive with genuine laughter. Her eyes are a brilliant, piercing blue, reflecting both warmth and an underlying intensity. She leans subtly against the Mandalorian beside her, a quiet intimacy in the shared space. He, a much younger Wes, with his dark, earnest eyes, offers a rare, unguarded smile, a hint of deep affection in his expression as he looks towards her, both utterly lost in the moment.

The subtle, yet unmistakable, curves and contours of the woman\u0027s face –  the very shape of her nose, the firm set of her jaw – echo unmistakably in Nadia. But it is the eyes, the twin pools of piercing, intense blue, that are the most potent, undeniable connection.",

She steps back from Varda, her hands clenching at her sides. **\"No! You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, Varda.\"** Her gaze, though still tearful, burns with a fierce, almost desperate conviction. **\"Storn and Ghurn... They raised me. They protected us. They are Clan Skirata. *That* is my family.\"**\n\nHer voice trembles, tears flowing anew, but the denial is absolute, fiercely defended. The suggestion of Wes as a \u0027father\u0027 cuts through her, a betrayal of every deeply held loyalty, of every carefully constructed truth of her life. The grief she just found solace in now warps into anger, then a profound, aching pain that seems to split her heart.\n\nShe turns from Varda, unable to hold the older woman\u0027s perceptive gaze any longer. **\"I... I have to tell Wes,\"** Nadia chokes out, the words ripped from her, laden with a fresh wave of grief, not just for her mother\u0027s death, but for the brutal knowledge of her last years. Her voice is barely a whisper, thick with anguish. **\"About her. What happened.\"**",

Her expression is calm, ancient, touched with something that feels almost like sorrow. Slowly, she steps around, her movements deliberate and graceful, until she is once again before Nadia, eyes level, voice low and warm. \"**You misunderstand me, Nadia *Skirata***\"  she says gently, the words carrying the quiet cadence of ritual. \"**I said you have gained a father, a biological one. But family…\"** She gestures lightly with one hand, tracing invisible threads in the air. \"**Family is a web, not a line. It stretches from blood to blood, from bone to bone… but also from love to love, from choice and will. Those bonds are no less real than the ones of flesh.**\"\n\nHer voice softens further, threaded through with an affection that feels almost like the Force itself, deep, patient, infinite. \"**Discovering another thread in your tapestry does not unweave the others. It only adds to the whole.**\"\n\nShe throws her arm wide, \"**The future is unthered and misted. You make of what you want. You may inform Wes, then you may develop a bond. Or you might seek to untether the bond as a whole. You have time, that much i can see. Their is no rush to make a decision**\"",

She turns to face the ancient witch, her eyes, though still swimming with tears, now hold a terrible, cold certainty. **\"It\u0027s not that easy.

She couldn\u0027t forsake the Order. And noble Wes, wouldn\u0027t ask her to choose between him and the Order. Knowing she\u0027d already had to give me up.\"** She looks from Varda\u0027s ancient face to the swirling, distant clouds of Bespin, seeing not the beauty, but the indifferent vastness of a universe that tears people apart.\n\n**\"Just a joke, Varda,\"** Nadia murmurs, a single tear escaping, glistening in the soft light of the promenade. **\"A cruel joke of the Force that would bind two people together... but make sure they could never be together.\"**",

Crossing the promenade, she gestures toward a bench half-lit by the Bespin glow realising this conversartion is not yet quite done. \"**Just as the tide is not cruel. Just as the void between stars is not cruel.\"**\n\nHer eyes drift upward, toward the endless clouds above, the faint hum of the city a distant echo beneath them. \"**They simply are. They move, they pull, they answer laws older than grief.**\"\n\nVarda sits, steepling her fingers, her expression pensive. \"**I may not belong to this age, but one truth reaches across them all. When the grand designs of men fail. They blame it on \u0027fate\u0027.**\" She spits the word like its a curse\n\n\"** Your mother’s Order, this ‘Jedi’,  was the cruel mistress of that design, not the Force.**\" Her voice softens, yet her words strike with precision. \"**The Force gave your mother and Wes a gift , a bond meant to remind them that love, too, is a current of the cosmos. Yet the Order taught them to fear it. To sever what was never meant to be severed.**\" She huffs through her nose. \"**Or that is what  can piece together**\"\n\nShe turns her gaze back to Nadia, eyes gleaming faintly in the dim light. \"**No, the Force does not tear.

The Dathomiri\u0027s words cut deep, not with cruelty, but with a terrible, undeniable truth. *Her mother’s Order was the cruel mistress of that design, not the Force*. The revelation that the Force had gifted Marina and Wes a bond, only for the Jedi to force them apart, twists a new kind of pain in Nadia\u0027s chest. It\u0027s an anger, cold and precise, not at the Force, but at the rigid dogma that claimed so much.\n\nShe recalls her mother\u0027s words, her lessons. Marina\u0027s quiet defiance of the Order\u0027s stance on attachment. Her secret longing for a life that was denied. A profound sense of what *could have been*, of a joy stolen, washes over Nadia, mingled with a bitter understanding of the sacrifices Marina was forced to make. The truth, now laid bare by Varda\u0027s ancient wisdom, is a heavier burden than she expected, but it clarifies much.\n\nWhen Varda proposes meditation, Nadia flinches. Her face, tear-streaked and pale in the dawn light, hardens with a grim resignation. The memory of futile attempts since waking, the mental static, the inability to find calm in the Force—it\u0027s a fresh scar.\n\n**\"Meditate?\"** Nadia whispers, the word catching in her throat, laced with a bitter, humorless laugh. She shakes her head, slowly. **\"I\u0027ve tried, Varda. Since the *Aether*. It\u0027s just static now. I can\u0027t... Not after what I felt. Not after what they did.\"** She looks up at Varda, her blue eyes pleading for understanding.",

The morning light catches the faint runes burned into her staff as she raises it, pointing its carved end toward Nadia like a duelist issuing a formal challenge. \"**Some meditations require stillness,\"** she says, her voice low and rough, the cadence of ritual hidden beneath the teasing tone. \"**Others demand movement, struggle, breath, fire. This one asks for all three.**\"\n\nShe plants her bare feet in the grass, grounding herself. The old witch’s silhouette, framed by the faint glow of Bespin’s clouds, looks less like that of a frail elder and more like a figure carved from the mythic past a creature of will and power, every inch of her alive with quiet defiance.\n\"**Come, Nadia.

Her words hang in the air, a profound challenge that cuts through Nadia\u0027s grief and self-doubt.\n\nThe young woman\u0027s gaze darts around the West Garden Promenade. Dawn is breaking, and though it is still early, the first few Cloud City citizens – early joggers, a lone Ugnaught sanitation worker – are beginning to appear on the curving paths. The thought of an overt display of the Force, of a direct confrontation, here in a public park, sends a jolt of visceral fear through her. Her training and her deep-seated awareness of the Empire\u0027s relentless hunt for Force-sensitives scream at her. It\u0027s too public. Too dangerous.\n\n**\"Varda, no!\"** Nadia whispers, her voice sharp, strained with a desperate urgency. She stands, her body tense, a subtle tremor running through her. **\"We can\u0027t. Not here. It\u0027s too public. The Wing Guard patrols... even at this hour. We don\u0027t attract attention.\"** Her gaze, though still cautious, is now pleading, her blue eyes reflecting a desperate plea for discretion, for safety. **\"To display it so openly... it\u0027s a beacon, Varda. A death sentence. For both of us.\"** Her hand instinctively go to her hip, hovering over where her blaster or her lightsaber would normally be.",

Force-caging sycophants.**\"\nHer staff lowers, thudding softly against the synth-grass. The flare of defiance in her eyes dims to a simmering glow as she stoops to retrieve her cloak.\n\nThe old witch’s movements are deliberate, but there’s a restless energy in them a contained storm, for a puzzle she cant quite solve. Without proper methods. It gets under her skin. The cloak rustles as she shakes it out, her mouth a hard, thin line. \"**I haven’t forgotten this,**\" she mutters, more to herself than to Nadia, though her voice carries the weight of a promise. \"**Words will not be enough to deal with this problem.**\"\n\nShe straightens, draping the cloak over her shoulders once more, the earlier mischief in her eyes replaced by something far older the haunted, brittle anger of someone who has lived through too many empires, too many cages dressed as ‘order’. Her gaze flicks toward the pale sky of Bespin, then back to Nadia. \"**I am sorry I can not offer you more advice, the force i can help you with, Grief i can try my best. We have walked the same road for many years. But you are not me. and... family is not something i am the most acquainted with.

When Varda crosses to her, placing a hand on her shoulder, Nadia flinches almost imperceptibly, but does not pull away. The touch is gentle, grounding, and Varda\u0027s words, softly spoken yet filled with ancient wisdom, penetrate Nadia\u0027s defenses with unexpected ease. The apology, the admission of personal limitations, is a fresh balm to Nadia\u0027s raw nerves. It\u0027s a humility Nadia rarely sees, a truth that cuts through the rigid facades so common in her world.\n\n**\"No, Varda,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice thick with emotion, her throat tight. She meets the old witch\u0027s gaze, her blue eyes shining. **\"You have given me... much, tonight. More than I had any right to ask.\"** The understanding in Varda\u0027s touch, the empathy, it\u0027s a lifeline.\n\nNadia\u0027s hand rises, trembling slightly, and she clasps Varda\u0027s, holding it firmly against her shoulder. The contact is solid, reassuring. **\"Thank you, Varda,\"** Nadia says again, her voice low and utterly sincere. **\"Truly. And you are right. When the time is right, I would very much appreciate your help with the Force.\"** She gives Varda\u0027s hand a small, firm squeeze, a renewed commitment echoing in her own eyes.",

When Varda\u0027s hand finally withdraws, Nadia\u0027s arm drops to her side, a profound, lingering sense of peace settling over her.\n\nShe stands for a long moment, simply breathing, allowing the silence of the promenade and the soft, fresh breeze to wash over her. Her gaze lifts to the horizon, where the faint blush of Bespin\u0027s distant sun is beginning to paint the upper layers of the gas giant\u0027s clouds in shades of rose and gold. The spectacular, silent tableau of the rising sun is a balm to her soul, a silent, powerful promise of return, of renewal. The light, she realizes, truly does come back, even after the longest night.\n\nWith a final, deep breath, Nadia turns, a renewed sense of purpose firming her stride. The profound emotional turmoil has been transmuted, not into oblivion, but into a quiet, fierce resolve.\n\n**\"The sun rises,\"** Nadia states, her voice low and clear, a subtle echo of Varda\u0027s own words from earlier in the night. She glances at Varda, a faint, almost imperceptible smile touching her lips. **\"Shall we return to the *Atin Oya\u0027ka*, Varda? We still have a long day ahead of us.\"**",

Her stride is purposeful, but there\u0027s a profound weariness etched on her face, in the faint shadows beneath her blue eyes. \n\nShe surveys the room, taking in Wes, Varda, Iyola, and Misha gathered around the table, the remnants of breakfast scattered before them. Then, she walks directly to the caf machine, pouring herself a steaming mug. The rich, earthy aroma does little to rouse her from her deep-seated fatigue.\n\n**\"Good morning,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice flat, almost devoid of emotion. She takes a long, slow sip of the scalding caf, then turns to face them, her blue eyes, though tired, clear and direct.\n\n**\"Vekka reports the initial diagnostics are complete,\"** Nadia states, her voice regaining a measure of professional composure. **\"They\u0027ve identified critical structural breaches and power conduit degradation. The maintenance droids from the *Venture* are now in the workshops for repair. He expects they\u0027ll be operational by this afternoon.\"** \n\nShe then sets her mug down on the table with a soft *clink*, her gaze sweeping over the group. **\"Ghurn has a mission for us.\"**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Notable-Allies#nadia-skirata\u003e)",

She doesn’t look up from her cup, only stares into the dark liquid as if divining meaning in the swirl of steam. The lively spark she’d carried that morning, the mischievous pulse that made her seem almost young, gutters out in an instant. Her fingers tighten around the caf mug, knuckles pale. The warmth doesn’t reach her. *A man too eager to command, she thinks. We bring him back from ruin, and he greets us with orders. No gratitude. No sense of the threads he tugs.*\n\nHer eyes flick briefly toward Nadia, then away again, sharp and assessing. *He will pull too hard on the web and tear it. That kind of pride always ends the same way.* She forces herself to sip from the cup, the bitterness grounding her. No need to speak. Words now would be wasted, another ripple in still water. Better to listen, to watch, to wait for the threads to shift. When she finally sets the mug down, it’s with deliberate quiet. Her gaze lingers on the table, distant but focused, the faintest curl of disdain ghosting her lips before it fades into something like resolve.",

Looking at the expression on her face he could see that she was tired.  Even tired may not have been the right word.  Exhausted, fit better.  To add more to emphasis she made a bee line to the caf machine.   His eyes shifted from the young Mandalorian to Varda and Iyola before moving back to Nadia.   His fingers absentminded spin the caf mug on the countertop.  *I wonder if she even got any sleep.*  He thought. \n\n\nAs she said good morning and updated them on the status of The *Ventures* repairs he simply nodded.  When she finished he was about to say he had already spoken with Eve but her next statement caught him off guard.   \n\n\nWhile he simply tilted his head and raised an eyebrow as Varda audibly scoffed and made no attempt to hide it.  He looked at the old woman as the right side of his mouth upturned into a small smirk.  It was silent in the galley.  One could have heard a pin drop of one had been available.   \n\n\n**”Really?  All of us, you included?”**  He said with a bit of surprise.   **”You’re exhausted and we aren’t much better.”**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

She wasn’t familiar with the older woman’s religion, but the description of Force powers was startling.  “**Wait, you knew someone who could change into a bird?  Can you change into an animal too, Varda?”**   *Or maybe Varda was just teasing her. *Mischief sometimes sparkled in those violet eyes; it was possible. \n\nWes managed to open a channel to Eve using his Mandalorian gauntlet.  Eve calmly updated them on the repairs - the droids were being fixed, and they were going to start patching up the hull damage.  Iyola’s thoughts drifted to the nanite controller she possessed.  It would probably be helpful, but she needed to play around with it first.\n\nShe was about to tell the group about the nanite controller when Nadia appeared, and Iyola fell silent.\n\nNadia explained that Ghurn had a mission for them, and even better, the ID cards were ready!  Wes explained that two hours might be short notice.  Iyola did not care about that at all.  It was time to get into Cloud City!  \n\nNadia referred to Wes as her sibling.  It was probably just a turn of phrase, but maybe.. Iyola looked back and forth from Wes and Nadia to see if she could perceive a family resemblance. It would be like this recalcitrant Mandalorians to not mention that Nadia and Wes were brother and sister.\n\nAs soon as Nadia finished talking, Iyola spoke.  **“I don’t need two hours.  I need about twenty minutes.  Just let me hit the showers and gear up.  Let me know if Serena Foss can turn some gems into credits for me, too.”**  Her gray eyes, formerly clouded from a restless night, were bright and eager.",

He gave her a smile as she said she’d be ready in twenty minutes.  \n\n\nHe looked back to Nadia who stood there holding the hot mug of caf.   It looks alike the hot drink was providing some relief to her weary state.   He also caught the small smile Iyola’s reaction had caused.  \n\n\nWes looked at Nadia.   If anyone was to simply look at her they would see the strong Mandalorian woman before them.  If one had the ability to look deeper they would see the cracks forming and growing larger.  What she had been through was horrendous.  She needed rest and the fact that she hadn’t had any was compromising her.   It would only be a matter of time before that would affect others.  Hopefully not at a time of crisis when she would be depended upon.   \n\n\nHe also felt her resolve.  Her uncle seemed to rely upon her a great deal.  It seems that her strength was needed.  Perhaps she was filling in for the loss of her mother in Ghurn’s operations.  It was normal.  For a child to step into their parents roles within the clan.  He knew that first hand.   He would have been expected to take his fathers place at the head of Clan Del-Fin.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

But a sister with adequate skill could craft wonders. I believe it was a sister from the clans of the singing mountains? If I\u0027m not incorrect, that could craft Items that could shift the mortal form, blur the lines between what is flesh and what is spirit.**\"\n\nHer gaze drifts slightly, as if remembering something distant and half-lost. \"**One such was the Talisman of the Raven. A relic of transformation. A way for a witch to walk unseen, to move as shadow, to learn what could not be spoken.***\" She laughs the distant look focusing back on Iyola \"**as well of course the ability to shfit into a raven**\"",

She flinches, the emotional resonance profound.\n\nShe then turns back to Wes, the admission a heavy weight. **\"You\u0027re right, Wes,\"** Nadia concedes, her voice raw, stripped of its previous composure. The admission is difficult, painful. She takes a slow, shaky breath, her shoulders slumping. **\"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m... I am not at my best. And that would endanger us all.\"** She presses her lips together.\n\nShe gives a reluctant, weary nod. **\"I will... inform Ghurn of my assessment. That I am unfit for immediate field duty. Serena will provide you with the ident cards, any credits you need exchanged. I will ensure you have all necessary data on Cloud City\u0027s layouts and potential contacts.\"** She pauses, then adds, her voice a low murmur, **\"But for now, I... I will sit this one out.

Just as you said he cares for his clan. Of which I am not.**\"\n\nThe chair scrapes as she stands \"**I shall take my leave. It appears I am stil far too emotional for such conversations. Again I must apogise. I will be there for the mission. Now I must meditate**\" \n\nShe stands and despite the anger. She makes effort to smile at everyone in the room.  As she passes Nadia \"**If sleep continues to evade you I have methods which can help. A dreamless sleep i may add.**\"",

        "content":  "Iyola is fascinated by Varda’s description of the artifact, the Talisman of the Raven. She wonders if she’d need to be a witch - how Varda refers to herself - to use it.  *Maybe I’ll look for it. Varda can tell me more about witches and where they reside.  *For a second she grabs for her commlink to tell Caz about their new quarry, but when she remembers, she lets her hand fall, a sudden sad wrench of pain in her chest.\n\nUnder Wes’s gentle probing, Nadia acknowledges being tired and unfit for duty, which for a Mandalorian like her must be a significant confession, to reveal weakness.  She watches Nadia’s face carefully as she speaks. Something clicks for her.\n\nVarda had earlier appeared dismissive of the mission.  Iyola sympathizes.  She doesn’t like being told what to do either.  Now, the older woman - the witch - grasps her staff and rails against the circumstances they find themselves in - being out of time, moved from one place to another, dependent on this clan of Mandalorians, unable, it seems, to practice her witch powers openly.  Her purple eyes flash angrily, almost seem to glow. She’s never seen Varda exhibit this kind of fury, not even when they’d been fighting on the *Aether*.  Iyola has a sudden headache from the tension of it all. \n\nVarda declares that she is going to meditate. That is something Iyola is not very good at.  What she is good at, however, is getting ready to move quickly, which is what she intends to do, after taking a shower.\n\nBut there’s one more thing she should do. ** “Uh, Nadia,”** Iyola says, addressing the young armored woman.  **“Can I speak with you in private before this mission?”  **",

The contact is firm, steady, and the empathy from his Force presence is a raw, soothing balm to her inner turmoil. His words, blunt and understanding, cut through her last defenses. She meets his gaze, her own blue eyes, though tired, now holding a deep, profound gratitude.\n\n**\"Thank you, Wes,\"** Nadia murmurs, her voice raw, close to breaking. **\"I will... I will tell him.\"** The admission is painful, but a weight seems to lift from her shoulders.\n\nThen Varda\u0027s anger erupts. Nadia watches her, a familiar pain flashing in her eyes at the older woman\u0027s words, at the profound weariness in Varda\u0027s own Force presence, the desperate struggle to contain the darkness. She closes her eyes for a fleeting second, bracing herself, and then meets Varda\u0027s gaze again, her expression grim but resolute.\n\nVarda\u0027s final words to her, the offer of \u0027dreamless sleep,\u0027 elicit only a small, almost imperceptible nod from Nadia, a quiet acknowledgment of the kindness offered.\n\nAs Varda scrapes her chair back and leaves, and the echoes of her anger settle, Iyola\u0027s voice cuts through the charged silence. Nadia turns, her focus snapping to the young explorer. **\"Okay, sure,\"** Nadia starts, she looks between those remaining before looking back to Iyola. **\"We can talk on the flight deck... or in your cabin.\"**\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Notable-Allies#nadia-skirata\u003e)",

        "content":  "**“How about my cabin,”**  Iyola said to Nadia.  “I need to go there anyway.” \n\nWhen Nadia entered, she’d see Iyola’s personal possessions strewn about, in an almost purposeful refutation of Mandalorian discipline.   One of the few items treated with care,  neatly hung on a chair, was Iyola’s beloved aqua-hued jacket.  Iyola reached into a pocket of the jacket and pulled out a pouch. \n\n**“I found this in this room,”** she told Nadia.  **“I think it belongs to you, or at least a member of your family.”  **She gave the pouch containing the hair and stone to Nadia. ** “And this was inside it too,” **she said, sharing the flimsi-photo. \n\n Iyola had spent some time looking at the flimsi-photo she’d found hidden in her quarters, a captured holomoment in time.  It was a very interesting artifact.  The image itself wasn’t posed or formal, but someone had spent time to preserve it.\n\nThe two young girls made her think of her older sisters, Peluna and Rusera.  What had happened to them?  It was so hard to think of her family, lost to her.  For her, Peluna and Rusera were still alive and well.  She wanted to keep them that way in her thoughts, as if they were just a comm away.\n\nShe didn’t recognize the planet, out of focus as it was.  But the young adult woman - maybe Iyola’s age, or younger - looked familiar to her, for some reason.  She was a Jedi, or at least she had a lightsaber.  But Jedi didn’t have families.  They couldn’t marry, or even really commit. \n\nEven more oddly, the woman and her children looked familiar. Then Iyola realized that the younger child was Nadia herself.  This must be her mother, and her sister. \n\n**“This is your family?”** she asked Nadia, watching her face as she looked at the photo.   **“The younger girl looks a lot like you.  As does your mother. Was she a Jedi, or did she just have a lightsaber?” **",

        "content":  "Nadia follows Iyola through the corridors, her mind still reeling from Wes\u0027s direct words. The quiet tension she holds is a taut string, stretched near its breaking point. As they enter Iyola\u0027s cabin, her blue eyes, though tired, take in the scattered personal effects.\n\nBut it\u0027s the sight of the small, woven pouch in Iyola\u0027s hand that makes Nadia freeze. Her gaze locks onto it, then to the spot where Iyola found it. A jolt, a flash of recognition so sharp it almost physically hurts, goes through her. *Her secret place.* A childish game, a hidden cache from a lifetime ago, when the *Atin Oya\u0027ka* was simply home, and the world was not yet shattered.\n\nNadia\u0027s hands, usually so steady, tremble visibly as she reaches out. She takes the pouch from Iyola, her fingers brushing the worn fabric with a reverence that betrays her carefully maintained composure. She pulls out the contents—the smooth river stone, the braided hair, and finally, the faded flimsiplast holopicture.\n\nHer breath catches in her throat as her eyes fall upon the image. It\u0027s her. Younger, a serious four-year-old with light brown hair, holding her mother\u0027s hand. Beside her, a grinning Kiera, a tiny toddler with slightly darker hair. And her mother... Marina. Young, vibrant, a lightsaber at her hip, a gentle, secret smile on her face. The verdant landscape, the terraced buildings.\n\nNadia clutches the picture, her knuckles white. A single tear, hot and defiant, traces a path down her cheek. Her voice, when it comes, is a raw, trembling whisper, heavy with suppressed emotion.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Notable-Allies#nadia-skirata\u003e)",

Yes he understood all too well how Nadia was feeling.  Bound by duty to serve no matter how you felt.   It spoke to her strength and character.  He admired it.   It told him that her parents raised her well.  \n\n\nRemembering that she said she lost her mother a couple years ago had caused him to take a deep breath in remembrance.  He had lost his mother a year or so before the purge.  The loss of one’s mother is never easy.  \n\n\nHe continued to sit quietly as he waited for the two women to come back to the galley.

One hand rises to press against her chest, her fingers curling briefly over the ache that has lingered since her awakening. A sharp breath escapes her lips, half-sigh, half-grimace, as the pain ripples through her ribs like a memory refusing to fade.\n\nThat was not her finest moment, she admits to herself with a low hum, a whisper of rueful honesty. Guilt stirs in her not a dramatic wave, but a quiet, stubborn tide that lingers in the hollow between heartbeats. Keeping Nadia awake for so long, dragging her into that night’s wanderings... it had been selfish, she knows. A hunger for the outside, for the pulse of life beyond walls and orders. A need she couldn’t quite cage.\n\nThe door to her quarters hisses open with its soft mechanical sigh. She slips inside, perching on the edge of her bed before easing back until her legs fold neatly beneath her. Her staff rests across her knees, its carved wood catching faint glints of light from the ship’s dim systems glow almost alive, almost listening.\n\nFor a long moment, she simply breathes. The kind of deep, steady breath that pulls through every scar and memory. Then, slowly, she closes her eyes. For the first time since she clawed her way back into this strange new life, Varda lets herself reach for the Force, not as a witch seeking vision or omen, not as a seer trying to pry open the veil of what will be. But as a woman searching for the heartbeat of what is.\n\nHer awareness unfurls like smoke through the metal halls: the ship’s soft hum beneath her palms, the far-off murmur of sleeping minds, the faint warmth of life even in the cold. The Force greets her, hesitant at first, then familiar, like an old friend finally remembered.",

Her dark hair is pulled back in a severe bun, and her posture is perfect, almost regally straight. She carries a sleek datapad and a slim, encrypted comm unit, her expression one of calm, detached efficiency. Her warm, polite smile rarely quite reaches her cool, intelligent eyes, giving her an aura of unshakeable competence. She exudes professionalism and an understated authority, a stark contrast to the more rugged Mandalorians.\n\nThe pair stand to one side, waiting as those attending begin to congregate and take their seats.",

He was looking at his bracer computer.  There was still no response from Nadia that she had received his message.  He sincerely hoped that the compiled notes and picture he attached would be enough to find Rin.  With no one nearby he brought up her picture.  He still remembered that day he saw her walk into the *Legs Akimbo*.  A seedy cantina on a Seperarist aligned planet.  It was where his life took an unexpected turn.   He looked up as others started to filter in.   With a tap of his finger he closed the file and turned off the screen.  Picking up his helmet he moved closer to where they would gather.  \n\n\nSensing that more were coming he turned towards the entrance just before the doors hissed open.  He spotted Ghurn walking next to a woman, who must have been Serena, who was striking and impeccably dressed.  He returned Ghurn’s nod as he moved towards the table.  He once again looked at Serena.  She was professionally dressed.   Wes assumed that she was the clan\u0027s front woman when it came to dealings both internally and externally.   She was calm, collected and professional.  \n\n\nStepping to the chair he set his helmet down and pulled out a chair.   Sitting down he was ready to hear about this mission that Ghurn needed.   He took a breath and let it out as he practiced a Jedi calming technique.  Unsure of what was ahead he figured it was the prudent thing to do.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

He gives Ghurn a wary nod, his expression flat, then sizes up Serena with a professional appraisal. *She\u0027s the numbers woman,* he assesses instantly, a lifetime of dealing with precise, unsentimental figures guiding his read. He makes a beeline for the synth-porridge dispenser, filling a bowl and stirring it with a practiced, absentminded flick of his wrist. He doesn\u0027t sit with the others at the table, preferring a stool further down, where he can listen and observe the room and its occupants without being at the direct center of attention.",

She clutches her copy of *The Temple Treasure* to her chest like a shield. Her uniform is still the simple grey fatigues from the *Venture*, making her feel even smaller next to the impeccably dressed Serena Foss. She offers a shy, almost imperceptible nod to Ghurn and Serena, her eyes wide with a mixture of intimidation and intense, technical curiosity. She quickly pours herself a steaming mug of caf and takes a seat near Dryzan, on another stool, a safe distance from the power players at the main table.",

He registers the scattered conversation, the underlying hum of nervous anticipation from the varied crew. His initial, grim tension has indeed softened, replaced by a more open, almost paternal, authority. He is no longer just processing a crisis; he is in command of the next phase.\n\n**\"Good morning, all,\"** Ghurn rumbles, his voice deep and clear, devoid of the harshness of his initial reunion with Nadia. He gestures for Serena to stand beside him. **\"And welcome, properly, to Kando\u0027s Coursers. I trust you all had adequate rest?\"** He nods towards the remaining food on the table, a clear indication that a basic level of care is always provided within his domain.\n\nHe then inclines his head slightly towards Iyola, a brief, almost imperceptible acknowledgment of her gratitude. **\"The *Oya\u0027ka* is home,\"** Ghurn states, his voice carrying a subtle, understated pride. **\"And her comforts are always available to those under our protection. We believe in providing for our guests, especially when those guests have demonstrated the kind of capability that warrants our... sustained interest.\"** A hint of a dry, almost approving smile touches his lips before quickly fading.",

For the time being, however, Iyola’s focus was on the here and now - Ghurn and Serena.\n\n**“Thank you,”** said Iyola.  **“As you probably know, I don’t have a chain code.  And I’d like to exchange some of these gems for credits I can use on Cloud City.  Should  I-  just give them to you?”**\n\n**“Once I learn more about the mission,”** Iyola said, warming to the mere idea of an exciting task,** “I might need to source some more equipment.  But I should be prepared for most general exploration.”  **\n\nA small voice of caution prickled in the back of her mind.  *This is a different time.  You might not understand the way things work now.*  She quashed it.  *Act first, figure it out later, right?  *",

The offer of continued use of the *Oya’ka* was expected and welcomed for the time being.  \n\n\nThe absence of Nadia didn’t go unnoticed.  Wes had hoped that she would speak to her Uncle with the intent on making sure he understood what she endured on the *Aether.*  When Ghurn gave a very brief update on Nadia he simply gave the man a nod in understanding.  \n\n\nWhen Serena spoke Wes could tell the woman was always on point.  For her to have the position she held in Ghurn’s operations she was obviously very good at what she did.  Her words were efficient and unwasted.  Straight and to the point.  \n\n\n**”Thank you.

When the last of the words settle, and she smiles a smile that could be either warm or warning. In this moment she embodies the mercurial winds. Its hard to pin her exact stance she seems to flip from one to another.\n\n\"**Well,**\" she begins, her tone light and lilting, \"**it’s been some time since I’ve seen a room so tightly strung. You can fairly hear the tension humming in the walls like a harp tuned by a nervous apprentice. Still,**\" she adds with a small chuckle, \"**it’s good to see such efficiency. There’s comfort in order, or so I’m told. It makes people think they’re safe.**\"\n\nShe inclines her head toward Ghurn with a genteel nod. \"**Chief Skirata, your hospitality is... formidable. I daresay few would think to offer lodging and a mission briefing in the same breath, efficient and intimidating all at once. Very Mandalorian of you. I’m almost flattered.***\"\n\nHer gaze slides to Serena, sharp as a needle and twice as quick. \"**And Miss Foss, what a ship you’ve kept. Not a mote of dust out of place. Everything gleaming, disciplined. You must terrify your crew. They probably love you for it.**\"\n\nThere’s laughter in her tone, but it isn’t cruel, just knowing. A witch’s laughter, old and amused, the sound of someone who’s seen too many storms to fear the thunder. \"**As for myself,**\" she continues, settling her staff before her like a cane, \"**you’ll find I’m not much for forms or files. The Dathomiri way of record-keeping tends to involve more smoke, fewer datapads. If you’re determined to catalogue me, you may need incense and a strong constitution. Alas I\u0027m not so stubborn as to move against the flow of time. I\u0027m sure if its needed one of my companions can help me with these chain codes?**\"",

It was evident that the spike in Ghurn’s and Serena’s emotions or the lack thereof meant that both were calm and not one’s to rise to verbal bait.  If it bothered either of them they both hid it well.  \n\n\nWith the pleasantries out of the way Serena took over.   Her order of business, their temp ident chips.  When he hears his alias that has been given to him he freezes for a quick second.  *Rin?*  He thought to himself wondering about the coincidence.  He let his breath out regaining his composure that broke for the slightest of seconds.  Bringing his focus back he looked at Serena for any follow ups she had and any info on this job Ghurn had.\n***\n\u003c:fett:1287130263851368489\u003e Helmet off [✎](\u003chttps://github.com/alicia86/SW_ForgottenOnes/wiki/Wes-Del-Fin\u003e)",

You name us, yet do not know us, you cast new shadows before we’ve even stepped into the light**\"\n\n\"**Hmm,**\" she hums under her breath, a note that’s equal parts amusement and warning. \"**I wonder what you’ve forced upon us with these borrowed masks. Perhaps something harmless. Or perhaps something true.**\"\n\nHer eyes flick to Wes and Iyola then. \"**Alas. you have named and so proclaimed. Nothing that can be done about It now.**\"\n\nVarda leans back slightly, the faint creak of her joints lost beneath the low hum of the ship. Then she exhales, a short, rasping sigh that carries both humour and fatigue. \"**Bah,**\" she mutters, lips curling into a wry smile. \"**Well, I’m not getting any younger, am I?**\" She tilts her head, sharp eyes narrowing with a spark of mischief. \"**What of this job you require of us, hmm?**\"\n\nHer tone carries the weight of long experience that peculiar blend of cynicism and curiosity that only the very old, or the very tired, can wield so gracefully. \"**Let’s have it, then,**\" she finishes, voice soft but steady. \"**Before my bones decide they’d rather turn to dust than wait for your briefing.**\"",

This provides you with a plausible, if non-descript, local address should you be queried by low-level security. The profile is sufficiently robust for basic public interactions, accessing public services, and standard commercial transactions.

You may remain together or split into smaller units, as the situation dictates. Your aliases are designed to function independently or as associates, representing a newly arrived \u0027business cohort.\u0027 How you leverage that narrative is at your discretion.\"**\n\nHer gaze then shifts to the mention of weapons and ascenders. **\"Cloud City\u0027s Casino District employs comprehensive sensor arrays at all major establishments. Standard sidearms are often permitted for registered security personnel or high-profile clients, but large, overt weaponry is typically scanned and held at a \u0027weaponry check\u0027 or openly displayed by authorized security staff. An ascender, particularly one with a blaster function, would almost certainly be flagged and temporarily confiscated, even from an authorized bodyguard. We advise discretion.\"**\n\nShe then turns to Wes. **\"Your \u0027Kalen Rynn\u0027 ident profile explicitly includes a secondary designation as a private security consultant, specializing in asset protection. Carrying a standard heavy blaster pistol in an open holster would be acceptable under this designation and would indeed facilitate your blending into that environment, as such personnel are common in the Casino District.\"** She offers a faint, professional smile. **\"We anticipated your needs in that regard.\"**",

She turns back to Wes, her dark eyes, intelligent and assessing, acknowledging his astute questions.\n\n**\"You are correct, Kalen,\"** Serena confirms, her voice even and precise. **\"The temporary ident profile is designed for discreet access to Cloud City\u0027s public and commercial sectors. It would not withstand a thorough investigation by any dedicated authority, nor a forensic analysis following a significant altercation involving lethal force. Should such an event occur, Kando\u0027s Coursers would be compelled to disavow any knowledge, and your ident would immediately be flagged as a fabrication. Your immediate directive, in such a scenario, would be to extract yourselves and return for re-evaluation and potential exfiltration.\"**\n\nShe pauses, then addresses his second concern, her gaze shifting to his side, subtly acknowledging the unspoken weapon. **\"Most standard public sensor checkpoints in the Casino District are configured for general metal detection and weapon profiling – primarily energy signatures and conventional ballistic identification. High-end establishments or private security firms may employ more advanced systems. However, active, dedicated bioscans or specific energy signature detection for is not a ubiquitous protocol unless an individual or specific threat is already flagged. Your disguise as a private security consultant, therefore, provides a significant layer of operational security. Our best advice is always vigilance, discretion, and avoidance of unnecessary direct scrutiny.\"**",
