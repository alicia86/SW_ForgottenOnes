The eight hours of forced, dreamless sleep have been a balm. The leaden weight in their limbs is gone, replaced by a manageable ache, the phantom pains of muscles remembering how to live.\n\nMost remarkably, when they open their eyes, the darkness is gone. The soft, ambient light of the barracks is clear and steady. The blindness, the most terrifying aspect of their awakening, has passed, leaving behind only the memory of its suffocating presence.\n\nA new sensation, or rather the lack of one, slowly registers. The deep, resonant hum of the hyperdrive that has been the constant, underlying note of their existence since leaving the *Aether* is gone. The ship is no longer rushing through a river of light. It is adrift.\n\nA chime, soft and clear, echoes through the barracks\u0027 internal speakers, followed by Eve\u0027s calm, synthesized voice.",

He didn’t even bother removing his Beskar’gam as he could already feel the weariness begin to overcome him.  Besides, sleeping in his armor was second nature to Mandalorian’s.  Removing his helmet he let it fall unceremoniously to the floor by the bunk.   As he sat back on the bunk he asked Eve a question.   It was *the* question that had been on his mind since he had awoken in the Medbay.  \n\n\n**”Eve I’m guessing that you have some extensive data banks on the galaxy\u0027s history.   Hopefully over the last twenty years.”**  He laid back on to the bunk as his weariness grew more oppressive.  Eve had responded back with an affirmative to his question.    **”Good.   Please look for the name Marina Cloudspinner.   Jedi Padawan assigned to Master Silas Draay.  Find any info you can on her and send it to my bracer computer.  Thanks. He took a deep breath as his vision darkened and he felt the redoubled effects of the cryo sleep descend upon him.   He did his best to fall into a Force trance that would allow him to heal quicker.  His body once again felt tired and used as he laid there.  Sleep, if what was claiming him, hit him hard.   \n\n\nThe next thing he remembered was Eve’s voice telling him that they had arrived at the system and recharging operations had begun.  Opening his eyes he discovered that his vision had returned.   With a slow and stiff effort his muscles all protested being asked to function in such a mundane effort as sitting.    He wondered what would happen if he asked more of his body right now.  Despite the aches and pains of movement he stood and attempted to stretch some of the stiffness and painful discomfort away.",

Old dathomiri chants wind down her spine. Bringing forth in her dreams arcs of lighting. But as all things do they all fade to black and Varda slowly sits up. \n\nShe begins to gather pouches and sashes. Forming her outfit. She unties her hair letting it flow down to her back in rivers of silver. she grasps her cane letting the strange warmth of shadowed sunlight and static od a storm yet to brake mesh and move with her own presence. She sits letting the last vestige of sleep finally fade.  Then with a sigh and a weary smile to herself at letting gravity torture some more she stands with her bones creaking. coughing slightly as the dryness of her throat she startles as she realises she has missed too many cups of tea in her absence. She walks slowly enjoying the veiw of the ship and taking the time to look at the blazing sun. Following the lights of what she hopes is the kitchen she meanders her way through. \n\nReaching it she takes a moment to untie a certain knot in her bag and with a twitch of the force she floats out a menagerie of tea cups and a strange tea pot.",

Lare and carved from a dark wood. the outside full to the brim of small runes painted in a light purple. The final cup is circular made of a pale white no personality. just a pale white cup. The teapot itself is made of a crystal. Crudely shaped and but done with love. She sets each out filling the tea pot with water and sprinkling her own herbs inside. She sets the water to boil then takes a seat herself letting the sound of the flame bring her comfort.",

The ship\u0027s immense, wing-like solar collectors are visible, their dark surfaces drinking in the raw energy. Next to the viewport is a simple control panel, clearly designed to adjust the filtration levels, allowing one to dim the star\u0027s brilliant glare to a comfortable, ambient glow. It is a room designed for quiet contemplation as much as for sustenance.",

The emptiness of his stomach was unlike anything he had felt before.   \n\n\nThe movement of his body felt good.  Tired and weary muscles stretched and loosened with every step.  As he walked he thought once again about Nadia and the familiar sense he felt.   How she looked at his clan sigil almost as if she was in disbelief of her own eyes.   He still couldn’t place her face or name.  Not recognizing her face wasn’t a surprise.   Judging from her age she seemed to be late teens or early twenties.  If he had seen her before she would have still been a young child.   As for her name it didn’t ring a bell.",

He sits, placing his lightsaber in front of him and entering a crisscross position, balling his fists and setting them on an adjacent knee; it\u0027s a daily meditation technique used to engage his mind for routine warmups.\n\nOnce done, he exits the room and walks toward the galley to get breakfast. He nods at those within the galley before walking towards the paste dispenser, but does not think much of those in the galley. Walking to a dispenser, he fills a bowl, then moves towards an isolated table to eat.",

I don’t use Force magic.  It can’t be that.  We all slipped up and made a mistake, and it’s bad luck.  Maybe we got caught in an experiment of some kind.  Something swapped my dataries for gems and wiped all the data and starmaps I had. Pretty sure a Jedi didn’t ruin my life because of Force stuff.”**\n\nShe approached the table.  \n\n**“Also, if there is any more of that stuff, can I have some?  It smells delicious.”  **",

The oppressive, moving bubble of light is gone, replaced by a clean, continuous glow from the overhead panels. The ship no longer feels like a tomb; it feels like a silent, empty, waiting vessel.\n\nFollowing the schematic on her datapad, she makes her way through a series of identical, spartan corridors, past the empty barracks, and deeper into the ship\u0027s mid-section. The doors to the areas marked \u0027Storage\u0027 and \u0027Workshop\u0027 hiss open as she approaches.\n\nThe space inside is vast, a multi-level bay that likely serves as both the primary cargo hold and the main workshop. A heavy-duty lift platform sits dormant in the center, and the upper walls are lined with catwalks and sealed storage lockers, each marked with arcane, alphanumeric designations.\n\nUnlike the rest of the ship, which is almost clinically sterile, this area shows faint signs of having once been a place of active work. There are faded scuff marks on the deck plating where heavy equipment was once dragged. Workbenches are bolted to the walls, their surfaces wiped clean but bearing the faint scars and chemical stains of countless projects. Empty tool racks and powered-down fabrication units line one wall.\n\nIt feels like a space that was meticulously scrubbed and decommissioned. All the tools, all the projects, all the personal effects of the last crew to work here have been systematically and thoroughly removed. The only things left are the fixtures, the faint ghosts of past labor, and a profound sense of emptiness. It is a perfectly functional workshop, waiting for a new crew and a new purpose.",

Thinking of her home ship brought on a brief, intense pang of sadness. *What had happened to her, to lose everything?*\n\nIyola shook her head.  *No time for that, not now.* The workshop had a few large pieces of equipment that were vaguely intriguing, but what really piqued her interest was the row of lockers on the upper catwalk.   This ship had clearly been scrubbed, *but no one can catch everything. *\n\nIyola looked around for the best route to access the catwalk.  She could use her ascender, of course, but there might be a ladder. At the very least, a free climb here would be fun.",

A quick scan of the area reveals her options.\n\nThe main lift platform in the center of the bay is clearly the primary method for reaching the upper catwalks. Its controls, however, are dark and unresponsive, likely deactivated to conserve power or awaiting a primary systems reboot. \n\nAt the far end of the bay, a standard-issue maintenance ladder is bolted to the wall, leading directly up to the main catwalk level. The bay walls themselves are not sheer; they are a network of thick power conduits, structural support beams, and recessed maintenance panels, offering a challenging but feasible path for a skilled climber. Above, the heavy girders supporting the catwalks are exposed, providing numerous solid anchor points for her ascension cable.",

The air up here is still and silent. She approaches the first bank of storage lockers. They are simple, grey, utilitarian containers, each sealed with a basic electronic lock that is currently unpowered. A manual release latch allows her to open them.\n\nThe first locker is empty. The second, the third, the fourth—all empty, wiped clean, not even a speck of dust remaining. The scrub was professional, thorough, and disheartening. She moves to the very last locker in the row, tucked away in a corner where the main lights cast a deep shadow. She pops the latch.\n\nThis one, too, is empty. For a moment, she feels a pang of disappointment. But as she starts to close the door, a faint, metallic scraping sound catches her ear. Something small and heavy just rolled in the back.\n\nKneeling down, she peers into the dark recess. There, tucked into the far corner behind a support strut, is something the cleanup crew missed. It\u0027s a handheld device, about the size of a heavy-duty hydrospanner. It\u0027s made of a dull, non-reflective metal, heavy for its size, with an ergonomic grip on one end and a complex-looking, crystalline emitter on the other. A small, dark viewscreen and a single, multi-function dial are its only controls. It looks like some kind of highly specialized diagnostic or calibration tool, unremarkable enough to be easily overlooked. When she picks it up, she feels a faint, almost imperceptible hum vibrating from within it.",

In the center of the room, a holographic dejarik table sits dormant, its projector dark. Comfortable-looking lounge chairs are arranged in a conversational grouping in one corner. Along another wall, a series of what look like enclosed simulation pods are powered down, their access doors sealed.\n\nBut what truly dominates the space is the far wall. It is not metal, but a massive, floor-to-ceiling holoscreen, currently displaying a breathtaking, hyper-realistic, and deeply serene image: a dense, alien forest of impossibly tall, bioluminescent trees, their glowing canopies filtering a soft, purple twilight. The image is not static; there is a gentle, almost imperceptible sway to the trees, the slow drift of glowing spores in the air. The scene is utterly silent, but it radiates a profound sense of peace and tranquility.\n\nLike the workshop, the room has been scrubbed of any personal effects—no stray datapads, no half-finished games, no personal trinkets. It is a perfectly preserved, perfectly empty space, waiting to be used.",

Not to mention the star map data she’d found.  *She and Caz had officially un-broken up that night.*\n\nThe grief hit her unexpectedly.  Iyola curled up in one of the cushy lounge chairs and wept. After a while, she pulled herself together and wiped her face off on her shirt. \n\n**“Eve, please change the image to something else pretty.  No jungles.”** \n\nShe walks over to the dejarik table, looking for a way to activate the game.\n\n** “Hey Eve, if those three are done with whatever they’re talking about”**  - *hopefully not arguing about *-  “**in the galley, can you ask them to come here and play dejarik with me?”**\n\n **“Also, what’s in those pods over there?” **",

The light coalesces into a new, equally breathtaking scene: a slow, silent drift through a vibrant, alien coral reef. Schools of tiny, silver fish dart between impossible structures of glowing, crimson coral, and a colossal, gentle creature resembling a manta ray glides peacefully in the simulated deep.\n\nIyola turns to the dejarik table. As if sensing her intent, the circular surface hums to life. A ring of light glows around its edge, and the projector in the center flickers, casting the three-dimensional, holographic forms of the game pieces onto the board. A grotesque Kintan Strider snarls silently at a lithe Ghhhk bird. The game is ready.",

Until it was broken there was no need to think otherwise.   \n\n\nHe was going to respond but Eve interrupted the three of them with an invitation from Iyola in the recreational facility.  He saw the shift in the man’s eyes as he answered that he was on the way.  Wes calmly stood as well.   **”Vaeros,”** He said to grab the man’s attention before he walked away.    **”Thank you.  You have my word as well.”**  \n\n\nAs Vaeros walked out he turned back to Varda and looked at the timer for Nadia.   Eve was going to wake her up in fifteen minutes.   He wanted to be there.  While he wouldn’t be a familiar face his armor would.   He hoped that it would put her at ease.  **”Eve is set to bring Nadia out of the healing cycle in about fifteen minutes.  Would you like to be there when that happens?  If you’d like to meet me there when you\u0027re ready it could be another friendly voice for her.”**  Picking up his helmet he turned for the door intent on heading to the Medbay.   \n\n\nMoments later he passed through the doors into the Medbay.  He turned his helmeted head towards the status screen of the pod that Nadia was in.   **”Eve, how is Nadia doing?  Is there anything I need to be watchful for when she wakes and afterwards?”**",

The steadily lit corridors, all identical grey metal and soft, indirect light, guide him aft. The ship is a silent, sterile labyrinth, and he moves through it with a deliberate, measured pace, the only sound the soft fall of his own boots.\n\nThe doors to the recreation facility slide open before him, revealing a space that is a stark, almost jarring contrast to the utilitarian nature of the ship. The lighting is warmer, softer. In the center of the room, the holographic dejarik table is now active, its miniature monsters frozen mid-snarl, awaiting the start of a game. Comfortable-looking lounge chairs are arranged in one corner, and along the far wall, the massive holoscreen displays a slow, silent drift through a vibrant, alien coral reef.\n\nIyola is there, standing by the dejarik table, looking up from the holographic pieces as he enters. The room, like the rest of the ship, is scrubbed clean of any personal touch, but here, at least, there is a sense of manufactured peace, a deliberate attempt at creating a space for rest in the cold, empty void.",

Thought began to run through his mind.   What were the odds of running across another Force Sensitive Mandalorian.   The numbers simply didn’t seem possible.

If anything caused him confusion it was that. \n\n\n**”Eve can you compile what you know of the Mandalorian clan, Skirita.   Who the major players are within and where they may be located.

Typically when you move a piece into another player’s square, you win that square and eliminate that piece.  There are exceptions, but we won’t play with those, because you’re new.  Some of the pieces move differently than others.  But we can go through those as we play.”** Once again, she points to the first two pieces. ** “That’s a Kintan, and it can push other pieces on your side one space if it’s next to them.  It moves one space at a time, only up/down and left/right.  That’s a Ghhhk, and it can move diagonally, any number of spaces.” **\n\n**“Oh, and usually you have to remember which ones are yours, but since you’re new I’ll ask Eve to color-code them once you choose.”**",

Knowing what family means to a clan he knew they would be happy to have one of their own back.     \n\n\nVarda\u0027s own recollection from hundreds of years ago only seems to cement the info Eve dug up.   It also made him wonder about his own clan and his Father Cal, the head of Clan Del-Fin.  They were in a precarious situation having one of their own hunted by the Empire simply for being what he was.    \n\n\n**”It follows what I know of them during the clone war.  It’s good to know that some things don’t change.”**  He glanced at the screen and looked at Eve’s face.  **”Eve, what can you tell me of the Mandalorian clan Del-Fin.  Lead by Cal Del-Fin.”**  He took a breath as he waited for what she knew.",

Imperial military logs from that period are heavily redacted, but they report significant armed conflict with unsanctioned Mandalorian forces and local insurgents.

Who knows, maybe they were right, if you didn’t even get to play baby dejarik.”  **\n \nIyola shook her head.  “**I don’t know who this Count Dooku is or what the deal is with the clones.  I keep hearing about a Clone War and I don’t know what that is.  But - what is this about fighting Jedi?  I still don’t know why the Jedi would fight you.  They don’t fight unless they have to. They would have just left you alone.” **\n\nShe glanced at the board to see which pieces had been randomly chosen.  “**OK, the next pieces are the Monnok and Grimtaash.  Monnok has one of the highest ranges since it can damage a piece from three squares away.  Grimtaash has high defense.” ****",

He could still remember the garbled communications he had with his Father after Order 66.  His urgent plea to join them on Raxus Prime and his fathers order to stay away.   Cal knew as well as Wes did.  That the Empire would be looking for him.  That if his son didn’t stay on the run he’d be captured and killed or worse.  \n\n\nIt was the only time he ever considered disobeying an order from his father.  Now another nine years had passed with no mention of Clan Del-Fin.   It might as well have been millennia.    \n\n\n**”That pretty much sums up what I know of what happened to my father and Clan Del-Fin.   If they scattered and went to ground, like my father always had a plan for, the Empire would never find them.  Well not all of them.   He’d buy his time before coming back if he was able to.   Another mystery to unravel.”**  \n\n\nAs Varda asked her own question to Eve his thoughts turned to Marina as he reached out into the Force.   Their bond always allowed them to know the other was alright.  See glimpses of what the other saw.  He hadn’t tried since waking up.   The way Eve made it sound he was shit off from the Force while in cryo.   That meant that she wouldn’t have been able to sense him.  Possibly thinking he was dead.  It was a sobering thought as he let his senses drift out to her in the moments he had left on the timer.",

He pushes past the immediate concerns—the ship, the strangers, the impossible gulf of time—and reaches for the one constant he has known for over a decade. It is a familiar, practiced act, like drawing a favored weapon. He casts the line of his consciousness out across the star-strewn void, seeking the unique, resonant hum in the Force that is Marina. It has always been there, a warm, steady light, sometimes faint with distance, but never, ever gone.\n\nBut when his senses arrive at the place she *should* be, there is nothing.\n\nIt is not just silence; it is a profound deafness where a constant, beautiful song used to be. The connection, the bond that has been a steady, reassuring presence in the back of his mind for over a decade, is not merely quiet. It is gone. Severed.\n\nHe recoils, the psychic shock a physical blow that makes him take an involuntary step back. He reaches out again, desperately this time, a frantic search for a thread that has been cut clean through. But there is only a cold, gaping void. A raw, empty space where a vital part of his own spirit used to be.\n\nThe Force, in its infinite and often cruel wisdom, offers only one explanation for a silence so absolute.",

        "content":  "Since the awakening of his ability with the Force Marina had always been there.  The bond they shared was one the Order had never heard of before.   It was what made them or perhaps just her master, Silas, decide to seperate them.  Neither of them had asked for it.  It just happened.  Was it a result of the feelings and love they had for each other.  He didn’t know but he knew neither of them would ever ask for it to change.   \n\n\nReaching out to her, sensing her presence, had become as easy as drawing breath.  When he found nothing he almost panicked.  Again he tried and again his attempt only resulted in an a profound emptiness.  An emptiness that only meant on thing.   The bond was no more.  \n\n\nHe took a weak step back.  The shock was a physical blow directly on the newly found scar on his midsection.   He felt it ache physically and within the Force.  As his hand rose to the same spot that his Beskar covered he reached out a third time.  Now the silence was deafening.  His mind screamed that it want possible but the reality was that the silence didn’t lie.    \n\n\nShe was gone.\n\n\n**”Marina.”** He said softly.  **”Please forgive me that I wasn’t there.”**  While the words were spoken softly there was a profound heaviness of sorrow and regret in the tone and his presence.\n\n\nA moment later the timer on his HUD began flashing red.   There was one minute left.  He blinked back the tears and pushed the feelings deep.   He needed time to reflect on them but this certainly wasn’t that time. When that time did come he’d be ready to embrace the somber realization that his love was gone.",

The memory of her walking away still felt as if he was watching part of himself walk away.  \n\n\nEve\u0027s voice brought him back to the here and now.    **”Understood Eve. You keep an eye on her and we will do the same.”**. \n\n\nWes watched the timer count down to zero.   As the clock stopped the tell tale hiss of the chamber sounded.  The blue light from within died away and the chamber opened up.  Inside lay Nadia still asleep but on the verge of waking up.  He saw her eyes flutter and her chest rise.  \n\n\nHe spoke softly in Mando’a. || **”You are safe Nadia.  You’re aboard our ship after rescuing you from the slaver ship.  You’ve been in our Medbay for a short time.  You can move but don’t rush it.  There are some clean fatigues to your right side.”** ||\n\n\nHe stood to the side in the same armor as before bearing the colors of his clan and the clans sigil on his left pauldron.   His blaster was at his side and still hanging from his utility belt was his lightsaber hilt.   He hadn’t hidden it yet.  It may have been because of Vaeros.  A known Inquisitor or perhaps he was just tired of keeping it hidden.",

The bed\u0027s bio-scanners immediately light up, casting a soft, analytical blue glow over her.\n\nShe lies there, a picture of fragile survival. The bio-sanitization cycle has cleaned away the grime of her captivity, but it could not erase the evidence of it. Her prisoner\u0027s smock, now clean, hangs loosely on her gaunt frame. Her skin, where it is not pale from malnutrition, is a faint, ugly tapestry of deep, mottled purple and yellow bruising, most noticeable on her arms and shoulders—the ghosts of brutal grips. She is stabilized, but far from healed.\n\nHer eyelids flutter, a tremor running through her. A low, soft moan escapes her lips as consciousness begins its slow, painful return. She awakens not to a jolt, but to a profound sense of *change*. The agonizing chemical need that has been her constant companion for weeks is gone, replaced by a deep, aching weariness in her body. The world is quiet. She is clean. This sensory disconnect is the first shock.\n\nHer training takes over. She does not panic. She goes completely still, her eyes cracking open to take in the dim, unfamiliar ceiling of the medbay. It is Wes\u0027s soft Mando\u0027a that grounds her, the familiar sounds a steady anchor in the disorienting sea of her return. Her eyes, now clear of the drug-induced haze, are terrifyingly alert. They slowly track from the ceiling to the source of the voice, landing on the armored Mandalorian standing a few paces away.",

He could tell that she was trying to figure out if she was in a worse situation than the one she was previously in.   Her head tracked to his voice when he spoke.   Eyes now alert and free of the drugs took him in.   He saw them dart to his shoulder where his sigil was proudly displayed.  The same flicker of recognition flashed for an instant before looking away.   \n\n\nShe began moving.  It was slow and gingerly at first.  As if she was taking in each movement for injury.   The discolored bruises that mostly covered her arms and shoulders apparently bore the brunt of the slavers\u0027 physical transgressions against her.  Now in a seated position he watched her look between Varda and himself.  She was doing the same thing he would be if the roles were reversed.   Assessing the situation and reading the room.  Figuring out if those that rescued her were friend or foe.   \n\n\nHer question wasn’t surprising nor was the unaccented basic. It was straight and to the point.  He reached for a container of water and slowly handed it to her.  **”You’re on the *Venture* with myself, Varda and three others.  And one other that we rescued off the slavers’ ship, Misha.”**  He took a step back after handing off the water.  **”My name is Wes.  Like I said before.   You’re safe here.”**",

She doesn\u0027t drink, but holds it, her fingers wrapped tightly around the container as if it were an anchor.\n\nHer gaze goes from Wes\u0027s face to Varda\u0027s, then back again with an unreadable expression, a carefully constructed wall of neutrality.\n\n**\"The *Venture*,\"** she repeats, the name a flat, toneless statement, not a question.

The container of water slips from her numb fingers, clattering onto the deck and spilling its contents in a dark pool at her feet. She doesn\u0027t seem to notice.\n\nShe stares at the door to the preservation chamber, her gaze fixed on it, but seeing something far away. Her lips part, but no sound comes out. Her carefully constructed walls, the ones that held back the storm of her trauma, have just been breached by a grief so absolute it needs no sound.\n\nThe tremors return, a violent, uncontrollable shudder that wracks her entire body. She wraps her arms around herself, hugging her knees to her chest, curling back into that small, tight ball of a survivor, her mind once again retreating from a reality that has become too sharp, too painful to bear.",

It wasn’t immediate but when the emotions took hold she saw the physical impact it had on her as well as feeling it in the Force.  Hearing that her friend was gone tore down the newly recreated wall she had erected to protect herself.   With the wall down he watched as she curled up to protect herself from whatever else the galaxy had in store for her.   \n\n\nIt took a bit of time but she finally started to regain some of that inner strength she had.  He knew it was there as he had witnessed it on the slaver\u0027s ship.  She needed to find it once more.   \n\n\nHe turned his attention to the monitors.   All readings were still green but stress levels were still high.   The quietness of the Medbay was deafening but it finally broke when she spoke.  Looking back he witnessed another change in her.   A quiet calmness that was wrapped up tight waiting to unravel.  She wanted to take him home.   \n\n\n**”Right now the *Venture* has its solar arrays deployed.   We’re in the Kinooine system recharging our critically low power reserves.  When that’s accomplished I see no problem getting you to where you need to go.  Perhaps we may find some help there as well.”**  He paused for a moment.  **”Eve, what\u0027s the time left on the solar recharge?   I’d also like to give Nadia passenger status, same as Misha.”**",

She pushes a stray strand of hair from her face, her movements slow but deliberate.\n\n**\"Ten hours is too long to wait. We\u0027re a ghost on the sensors now, but that won\u0027t last.

A place to get parts for this ship, gather intel, and disappear. I know a place. Cloud City, on Bespin. It\u0027s... neutral enough. My uncle runs a security firm there. He\u0027s discreet. He has resources. He can help us.\"**\n\nShe looks from Wes to Varda, her gaze intense.

As for your family, they are right. Jedi are often brought into the order when they are babies, and do not know their parents. I don\u0027t know my parents, but sometimes I wish I did. Having that kind of companionship is often rare and far between in my line of work.\"**\n\n**\"As for the Clone Wars, the Jedi deliberately involved themselves in the war and politics, especially as generals. This caused a massive rift in the order, as it often separated the peacekeepers from the war hawks. I was on the side of the peacekeepers, but due to our skills, we were always used. I did not trust the clones, and neither did most of the Jedi. They viewed them like droids with a human\u0027s skin; I didn\u0027t, but it felt so weird compared to the Stark Hyperspace war, when it was judicial forces fighting pirates.\"**\n\n**\"Regardless, the Jedi were heavily involved in the war, often as frontline soldiers. The issue was that there were only about 10000 in the order, and even fewer as qualified warriors, so younger padawans or other branches of the Jedi were called to fill the gaps. I did not want to be a part of it, and separated from my Master. If I were to fight, I would fight for a people I can see the positivity being used, and not by the Coruscant elite.\" **\n\nVaeros sighs, ** \"Of course, I\u0027m partially hypocritical, as I forsook the order and peacekeeping in favor of supporting the Separatists: disenfranchised Republic citizens.\"**",

Is that right?”**  she asked.  *And there had been another war before this one, as well, the Hyperspace War. *  ** “I can ask Eve for the details.  But just tell me, how long ago was this?  What’s the last time you can remember?”**\n\nShe sighed a bit. ** “It just seems like everything became terrible. The Jedi I knew were explorers and diplomats and biologists, not warmongers. And they were generally pretty OK.  I mean, a few of them were skugholes and egoists, sure.  They were people, like everyone else, just magic people with a lot of rules.”  **\n\n**“Anyway, we’ve got a game to play.”**  Iyola smiled at Vaeros. ** “So the next two up are the Bulbous and the K’lor.  The Bulbous will kill any piece it sits next to for three turns consecutively. The K\u0027lor  moves up to three spaces in any direction except diagonally.  You chose the last two times first, so now I\u0027m going to pick.\"\"**  With that said, she delicately tapped the Bulbous, placing it in the center left of the board as she faced it.\n\n**“You didn’t color code your pieces,**”  Iyola pointed out.  **“I mean, you technically don’t have to because I color coded mine, but it’s still a good thing to do.”**",

It’s been almost twenty years since I was last there.”**  He saw the determined look on her face and decided to try a different approach.  He brought his hands up and removed his helmet.

She stares at him, then at Varda, as if seeing them for the first time not as rescuers, but as impossible, living ghosts. The implications are too vast, too complex for her fractured mind to fully process. It is another layer of impossibility piled upon an already unbearable reality. She says nothing more and simply retreats back into a silent, watchful stillness.",

Perhaps the Force put us all together to help each other.  The *Venture* needs some time to power up.  According to Eve we don’t need a full ten hours but we will need more than four to be safe.  Arriving with no power and crashing or spinning out of control will help no one.”** \n\n\nHe realized he was throwing a lot at her and took a step back. **”You’re probably hungry.  There isn’t much for food but there is nutrient paste.  It’s fairly bland but it will be good for you.

He must have had a hard life, and was clearly a battle-tested warrior. *That scar was no joke.* Being a Jedi in this era was apparently different than it had been in her time. Yet at the same time he seemed sweet, maybe sheltered, in a way.  *It was odd. * He also kept avoiding her questions about how long he’d been frozen.  Maybe he didn’t know, or didn’t want to think about it. \n\n**“So these are the last two we place,” **she said.  **“This,”** she indicated a large reptilian chomping its jaws,** ‘is the Mantellian Savrip. It’s really strong and will take out even the few pieces that have high defense in one blow.  And this is the Houjix.  If it takes out a piece, it can move again.  So go ahead and choose your piece and place it.  The Savrip, I like to think of actually as more of a defender, and the Houjix benefits from mobility, so think about that when you choose your starting square.”  **Really, she should have chosen again, but she was trying to make it easy on  Vaeros.  **“Once we place, we begin. I’ll let you start. This can just be a learning game so don’t worry too much about it.  We won’t wager unless you want to.”**\n\n**“Oh, I should have mentioned this draft variant.  You might have noticed that we didn’t place the Scrimp,” **she said, pointing to an odd eyeless tentacle-beast, **“and the Karkath.  In Spira Draft, once the first piece is lost, the game automatically puts in one of those last  two pieces in a random space.  You don’t choose which one.  Same with the second piece.  Make sense?” **\n\n**“You can go first,” **Iyola generously offered. In the background projection, a pink-hued nonapod wriggled its way across the screen.",

Nadia remains curled on herself.\n\nWes\u0027s apology, delivered in a gentle Basic after the familiar comfort of Mando\u0027a, is a soft knock on the door of her fortress. She doesn\u0027t open it, but she hears it. The tension in her shoulders lessens by a fraction. His logic about the ship\u0027s power is sound; the trained part of her mind, the part that understands mission parameters and risk assessment, acknowledges the truth in his words, even if her raw survival instinct still screams to flee.\n\nThen comes Varda\u0027s vision.\n\nFor Nadia, whose own senses are a raw, open wound, it\u0027s an overwhelming event. She flinches as she feels the old woman\u0027s presence swell, a sudden storm of power that fills the room, followed by the terrifying, jagged recoil of that *other*, broken thing Varda carries within her. It\u0027s a frightening display, but it is followed by a statement of absolute, preternatural certainty: *We will be safe*.\n\nComing from a Force-user of such obvious power, the words land with the weight of prophecy. It\u0027s the first solid thing Nadia has had to hold onto since waking up. She looks up first and Varda and then to Wes, her gaze traveling to his face. The fear of immediate discovery, which had been a driving, frantic terror, is now countered by Varda\u0027s assurance. The tactical risk of waiting has been weighed against the tactical risk of arriving helpless.",

She gives a single, small, almost imperceptible nod. **\"Okay,\"** she whispers, the word barely audible.\n\nShe slowly, carefully, pushes herself off the diagnostic bed. Her bare feet touch the cold deck plating, and for a moment, she wavers, a tremor running through her gaunt frame. The sterile, grey smock she wears offers no warmth and little dignity. It\u0027s a shapeless, threadbare garment, stained and ripped at the shoulder, hanging loosely on her. It ends just above her knees, leaving her thin legs and arms exposed, a stark canvas for the faint, mottled roadmap of bruises left by her captors.",

Her gaze drops to the simple, grey fatigues resting on the nearby tray, then back to the threadbare smock she\u0027s wearing. A flicker of something—shame, perhaps, or just a desperate need for a scrap of normalcy—crosses her face.\n\nShe looks at Varda, her eyes conveying a silent, weary gratitude. She gives another small nod and, with a trembling hand, reaches for the folded clothes, her movements still slow and uncertain. The offer of help, of a moment of privacy, is a kindness she had forgotten existed.\n\nNadia\u0027s trembling fingers close around the folded grey fatigues. The fabric is rough, simple, but clean. It is the most normal thing she has touched in weeks. She gives Varda a single, sharp nod of gratitude, a silent acceptance of the offer for privacy. Her eyes find one of the medbay\u0027s small, partitioned sanitation units, and she moves toward it, her steps still unsteady but now filled with a quiet, desperate purpose.\n\nA few minutes later, she emerges. The transformation is subtle, but profound. The prisoner\u0027s smock is gone, and with it, some of the raw, exposed vulnerability she carried. The simple, grey shipboard fatigues, though loose on her gaunt frame, provide a layer of anonymity, of psychological armor. Her posture is a fraction straighter, her expression still haunted, but the abject terror has been replaced by a carefully constructed wall of stoic neutrality.\n\nShe walks back to where Wes and Varda are waiting, her bare feet silent on the cold deck plating. She stops before Wes, her gaze meeting his, now clear and unnervingly direct.\n\n**\"The galley,\"** she says, her voice still a low rasp, but now it is a statement of intent, not a question. **\"You offered food.\"**",

When she comes back saying that they will be safe for the ten hours it was enough for Nadia to finally relax.   As she looked from Vaeda and back to him the feeling once again needles at him.   It was as if she was looking at him and through him at the same time.  She said okay when food. Was mentioned but she still didn’t seem to be present in the moment.   \n\n\nVarda’s mention of her changing her clothes seemed to bring her out of it.  The idea of leaving the horrible identity of a captive behind seems to give her a little motivation.   When she moved off to one of the partitions he turned and looked at Varda.  He looked at the old woman with a new respect.  **”Thank you.   I’m not sure I could have gotten her to go along.   Can’t say I blame her.  Still though,”**  He spoke softly as he looked to where she disappeared behind the partition.  **”The way she looks at me I feel like she knows something.   Maybe it has to do with Clan Del-Fin.”**  He shook his head knowing now wasn’t the time to ask.   \n\n\nWhen Nadia came back out he noticed the subtle differences.  How she moved.  How she stood.  How she presented herself.   It wasn’t leaps and bounds but it was a few small steps in the right direction.  She once again looked between the two of them and her gaze fell upon him once more as he mentioned the galley and food.  **”Yes I did.  It’s only nutrient paste but it will do the job for now.”**  He looked down at her bare feel and raised an eyebrow.  **”Not that you can’t walk around barefoot but we did secure your equipment chest when we left the *Aether.* Perhaps there is something there you can wear?  Then food.”**  He gave her a small smile as he let her think about it.",

Her breath catches, her eyes widening with a fresh wave of panic. The memory of the trap, the relay, the knowledge that her own possessions were turned into a weapon against her, comes rushing back.\n\nFor a long, tense second, she stands frozen, her hand clutching her neck, her mind caught between the desire for the safety of her armor and the terror of the trap it represents.\n\nThen, slowly, her fingers uncurl. She touches the chafed, raw skin of her throat. It\u0027s real. The collar is gone. The fear is still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it is now overlaid with a cold, pragmatic calculation. **\"Yes,\"** she says, her voice low but steady, the decision made. **\"My gear.

All that remained was the bruising and emotional scars that he knew would remain long after the physical ones had healed.   \n\n\nHe stood there as she fought her inner demons knowing that she needed to do this on her own.   Instead of interfering he stood guard as if protecting her from any and all things that would harm her.  Seconds ticked by and her fingers uncurled from her neck as she once again rooted herself.  Her voice now low but steady agreed.   Her gear then food.   \n\n\nHe gave her a nod.  **”Gear then food.”**  He gave her a smile as he motioned for them to fall in beside him as he led Nadia to her equipment locker and perhaps a small sense of relief.",

They move through the now fully-lit, sterile corridors of the *Venture*, a silent trio heading back toward the airlock antechamber where the rescued chest awaits.\n\nThe journey is short. As they arrive, the heavy durasteel chest sits where Iyola and Dryzan left it, an imposing, silent object in the middle of the floor. Its presence is a stark reminder of their violent escape and the dangers they faced.\n\nNadia stops a few paces from it, her gaze fixed on the Rekr sigil etched into its surface. The memory of the trap, of her own gear being turned into a potential instrument of her torture, is a palpable weight in the air. She looks from the chest to Wes, a silent, unspoken question in her eyes. It is not just a box of equipment; it is a final test, a final barrier between her and reclaiming a piece of herself.",

The fear is still there, a cold coiling in her gut, but beneath it, something else is stirring—a flicker of defiance, a spark of the warrior she used to be. She will not be a victim. Not anymore.\n\nShe walks forward, her steps steady, and kneels before the heavy container. Her fingers, still trembling slightly, trace the outline of the snarling Rekr wolf on the lid, a moment of silent connection to her clan, to her family.\n\nThen, with a final, steadying breath, she reaches for the latch. She doesn\u0027t hesitate. She doesn\u0027t flinch. She simply acts.\n\nThere is a soft, metallic *click* as the lock disengages. No explosion. No jolt of electricity. No signal to a madman. Only the quiet, mundane sound of a box being opened.\n\nShe lifts the heavy lid. Inside, nestled in the dark interior, is the familiar, comforting sight of her black and blue Mandalorian armor. It is her identity, her strength, her past and her future, all waiting for her. A single, heavy tear of pure, unadulterated relief rolls down her cheek and splashes onto the beskar. She is no longer just a victim. She is a Mandalorian again.",

She pushes aside the folded sections of her beskar armor—the pauldrons, the chest plate, the vambraces—her hands moving with a practiced familiarity. She is taking a silent, mental inventory, ensuring every piece is where it should be.\n\nShe gently shifts a small, neatly folded pile of dark grey fatigues and a compact tool kit to one side. It is Derek\u0027s gear. She pauses for a fraction of a second, her hand resting on the fabric, a flicker of pain crossing her face before she walls it off again, her expression returning to a stoic mask.\n\nHer search seems to be for something specific. She retrieves a pair of sturdy, knee-high combat boots and a pair of thick, woolen stockings, setting them beside her on the deck. She is still not satisfied. Her hands continue to rummage through the chest, moving past pouches of energy cells and a holstered blaster pistol.\n\nThen, her fingers close around it. She pulls out a simple, cylindrical object. It is a lightsaber hilt, crafted from unadorned, practical durasteel, its grip wrapped in worn, dark synth-cord. It is not a flashy or elegant weapon; it is a tool, built for function, not for show. She holds it for a moment, its familiar weight a solid, comforting presence in her hand, before carefully clipping it to the utility belt that is already part of the fatigues she wears.",

She had taken another step on her recovery.    There was silence in the airlock antechamber.   Muted noises came from the box as she rummaged through it.  A pair of high boots and stockings found their way to the floor.   After that she pulled out one more object.   It was functional more than elegant and flashy like many he saw during the war.  This was meant to be used and respected.  When she clipped it to the belt he gave her a nod and knew that this was the time to tell her about one of the others on board.  Better to know ahead of time then to be surprised and taken unaware.   \n\n\n**”Nadia there is one on board who was in cryo like the rest of us.”**  He paused for a second.   **”Im sure we were all out in there for a reason.  Surely no one here knows why.  He’s a Fallen Jedi.  He fought alongside myself, Varda and the others to free you from *Aether*.”**  Wes chose the word fallen over dark for obvious reasons.  After the fall there was lots of grey in the galaxy.   As for Vaeros he still hadn’t made up his mind yet but he did help rescue Nadia, Misha and recover Derek.",

She stands, the simple act of being properly shod a small but significant step in reclaiming herself.

The galaxy you remember... it\u0027s gone.\"**\n\nHer gaze becomes distant, as if reciting a grim history lesson she has learned firsthand.\n\n**\"The first decade after the Empire rose... it was a purge. The Jedi weren\u0027t just defeated; they were systematically hunted, vilified, and exterminated. To the Core Worlds, they\u0027re boogeymen now, traitors from a history book written by the victors. Anyone showing even a hint of sensitivity is a target—for Inquisitors, for bounty hunters, for anyone looking to curry favor with the Empire.\"**\n\nShe lets out a slow, weary breath.\n\n**\"Out here, on the fringes... people have longer memories and shorter loyalties. They might not bat an eye if you ignite one of these,\"** she gestures to their weapons, **\"as long as it\u0027s on their side of a fight. But the closer you get to civilized space, the more a lightsaber stops being a symbol of a peacekeeper and becomes a beacon. A target. A death sentence.\"**\n\nShe looks at them both, her eyes filled with a grim, weary warning. **\"It is not a weapon to be drawn lightly.\"**",

        "content":  "Wes caught the unspoken look Nadia gave him when he mentioned the Dark Jedi that was also aboard.   He considered telling her what Valero’s was but when Varda mentioned about judging the man for who he is now and not who he was he simply gave her a nod.  He looked back at Nadia and nodded again.  The same look with a feeling of caution he sent out to both of the women.  \n\n\nAs Nadia stood he saw a change in her.  The act of claiming her heritage and who she was did more for her than anything else he could think of.    Her quip about Varda’s invite being lost when it came to a lightsaber brought a wry smile to his face.  Her humor reminded him of Marina and the thought caused it to fall slightly.   A small bit of regret rose up within him as he remembered how he couldn’t sense her.   \n\n\nAs Nadia started to speak again he dealt with the feeling and listened as she stated the current state of affairs in the galaxy.   Only being nine years removed it was still pretty much the same.  The Empire ruled with an iron grip.  Any and all things Jedi related was dealt with quickly and with no consequences for anyone involved.",

It was about five months before Order 66.”**  He thought back to the day when he left for the Chu’unthor II.  Master Silas had thought it best that the two of them were separated.  **”After that fateful mission I was sent to train with the Altisian Jedi who were based out of Bespin.  Order 66 happened a couple months after that.   I was on the run for years.   Separated from loved ones and Clan in an effort to protect them.  I knew my presence would be a danger to them all”**  He looked at Varda knowing that she had heard some of this before.  **”I came back from the outer regions and decided to help.  I had a ship and got caught up with a group that helped people and families get out from under the Empire.”**  \n\n\nHe looked at Nadia hoping that she understood that he had some idea of what was out there if they weren’t careful.  **”There was a fledgling resistance then.

They call themselves the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Rebel Alliance.\"**\n\nShe shifts her weight, her voice taking on the tone of someone reciting battlefield intelligence.\n\n**\"They\u0027re not just scattered cells anymore. They have fleets, organized command structures. They\u0027ve won victories—small ones, but significant. They\u0027ve bloodied the Empire\u0027s nose enough that the Emperor takes them seriously. He\u0027s diverted entire sector fleets to hunt them down. It\u0027s a real war now. Desperate, bloody, fought in the shadows and the forgotten corners of the galaxy. Every day, the Empire\u0027s grip gets tighter, and every day, the Alliance finds a new way to slip through their fingers. It\u0027s the only real hope there is.\"**",

That wasn’t so surprising, she supposed; Jedi were known to be able to hear thoughts.  *I can easily test that theory later. *\n\n**“Now you’ve made me curious,”**  Iyola said.  **“What you thought I’d be like, and what you think I’m like.  You’ve got to tell me.”**  She placed the Savrip four lateral squares from the Bulbous, its scaly bulk now tinted green. \n\n**“I’m still a bit confused when it comes to this new year system,” **she confessed. **“You’re from (30 bby)?  Or maybe (25bby?) Is that right?”**\n\nShe glanced down at his gem, twinkling in the shifting light of the dejarik holoprojection. It was pretty enough, but credits had never been her motivation.  **“Tell you what,”** she said. **“You’re a researcher, you like to know things, right?  I like to find things out too.  Forget the gems. Let’s wager information.  If I win, I ask you a question and you have to answer.  Same for me.” ** She smiled winningly.  **“Sounds good?”**\n\nShe looked up as Varda entered the room.  **“Oh, hi Varda,”** she said.  **“Vaeros and I are about to play dejarik, the Spira Draft variant, if you know it. It’s his first game of dejarik ever!’ **\n\nIyola folded her hands together as she examined the distribution of the pieces.  Already, the holograms were snapping and straining and wriggling, eager to enter combat.  She lifted her head and looked him directly in the eye.  **“Your move,”** she said.",

The cells were an unorganized mess of missmashed groups.  If they were becoming a cohesive fighting group that meant they got some real leadership.  He had many questions but now wasn’t the time.   He had promised her food and then meant the galley and then maybe the red room where Iyola and Vaeros had gone.   \n\n\nAs if his mind was being read Varda excused herself.   Mentioning joining the others and offering Nadia an ear if needed.    Wes nodded.  **“Thanks for helping me, Varda.   We’ll join you in the rec area soon.”**  \n\n\nAs Varda left the airlock antechamber Wes turned for the galley.   **”The galley is this way.”** As they strode out into the corridor he had much he wanted to ask but kept it contained for the moment.   **”Do you want to get a message out to anyone?

A shadow passes over her features, and she is quiet for several long strides, the silence filled only by the hum of the ship. She can feel his unspoken curiosity, a dozen questions humming just beneath the surface of his calm demeanor. It\u0027s not an aggressive probe, but it\u0027s there—a pressure, an expectation.\n\n**\"No,\"** she says finally, her voice low and flat, her gaze fixed on the corridor ahead. **\"Everyone who would be looking for me... thinks I\u0027m dead.\"**\n\nShe lets the stark finality of that statement hang in the air for a moment, a wall to stop the questions she can feel him wanting to ask. After another few steps, she lets out a slow, weary sigh, as if deciding to offer a partial explanation.\n\n**\"The only ones who would care are on Bespin,\"** she clarifies, her tone still guarded. **\"I can\u0027t risk an open transmission from a ghost ship like this. It\u0027s better to send a secure message once we\u0027re in-system, through channels I trust. I\u0027ve been gone for weeks. A few more days to do this right... it won\u0027t change anything.\"**\n\nHer words effectively close the door on the topic, framing her silence not as secrecy, but as a grim, pragmatic necessity.",

For Nadia, stepping into the room is a stark, almost physical shock. After two weeks in a cramped, filthy cell, the sheer *openness* of the space is disorienting. Her gaze sweeps across the room, taking in the clean metal tables, the ordered dispensers, and, finally, the massive viewport that dominates the far wall.\n\nShe stops dead, her breath catching in her throat.\n\nThrough the viewport, the unfiltered light of the Kinooine sun blazes, a colossal, brilliant sphere of white-gold fire hanging in the infinite blackness. It is a view of overwhelming scale, of silent, terrifying, beautiful majesty. For someone whose entire world has been four metal walls, the sudden, violent reminder of the sheer size of the galaxy is a staggering blow.\n\nShe says nothing, but she slowly walks toward the viewport, drawn by the light. She stops a few feet away, her reflection a small, wavering silhouette against the stellar fire, looking like a lost soul who has just stumbled upon the face of a god.",

He held up a hand to hold off and snap questions.   **”Eve seems to have quite the extensive database.  Seeing.

He listened as she talked about Ghurn and his brother took her mother into the clan and accepted her and her sister.   He nodded.   **”Family is more than just blood.  It’s forged by commitment and trust and it can happen when you’re not even expecting it.”**  \n\n\nHe thought of Fakir and how his family circle expanded by two.  Marina and the child she had not long before they met.   While he never met her daughter or even knew her name, he sensed her when Marina gave him his first test in the Force.   She was still an infant secreted away somewhere safe.  The memory stirred emotions that were long put away so they couldn’t be used against him.   \n\n\nHe took a small drink and let out a quiet sigh.  **”It”s good you three found a place to belong.  A safe place.  The Skirita have a long history.  One that is good and honorable.”**",

She was still unfamiliar with the *Venture.*  They all were if he had to be honest.  In his time spent across the galaxy he had never seen a ship like her.  \n\n\nShe took a seat to his right and he admired her thinking.  It was practical and tactical, allowing her to talk freely while keeping an eye on the galley’s entrance.   She ate in silence and he let her, knowing that when she was ready she’d talk more.  He was looking at his bracer checking on the ships status when he heard the *clink* of the utensil on the plate.   Looking up he could see the look in her eyes as she asked about the Clan Sigil he wore.  Clan Del-Fin.  There was a bit of a surprised look on his face when she mentioned Raxus Prime.  His father and the clan were there on a covert mission when Order 66 was initiated.  Not many knew they were there and he wondered how she knew.   \n\n\nHe gave her a nod.  **”Yes, I wear the Sigil proudly.  I was born into the clan.”**  He paused, taking a drink of his water.  Being asked about the Del-Fin made him wonder about his father and if the man was still alive.  Even though his father wasn’t Force sensitive he always figured he’d know if his dad had died.   Yet being in cryo for nine years so much could have happened.  **”They were on Raxus Prime.  Providing covert combat support at the beginning of the fall.   I was with the Altisian Jedi when it all started.  A small group of us were on New Holstice at the Jedi Memorial when the clones turned.”**  He shook his head at the memory.  Sadness for what transpired and taking the first shot in defense of himself and fellow students and younglings.",

Her nod of understanding told him she was familiar with such situations.  It was a stark reality.  She wasn’t much older than he was when the Republic fell.  The life they led wasn’t an easy one.   \n\n\nWhen she spoke of her mother giving her a similar order it resonated within him.   He felt the emotion similar to his at having to make a choice that potentially had a bad outcome no matter the path you took.   You simply had to live with it.   \n\n\nHe felt her reign in her emotions and her face went back to the one of control and not giving anything away.  When she asked about the Altisian Jedi he smiled.   Apparently her mother was trained by the Main Order.  He gave a small chuckle when she asked how they were different.  \n\n\nHe took a breath remembering the first couple months.  **”Their training and ethics were just as strong as the main order but one of the reasons I was sent was that they accepted initiates of any age.  Since I was just turning seventeen when the order made up their mind with what to do with me I didn’t fit the mold of a padawan learner in any way.”**  He smiled when he saw her grin as she was probably imagining a fully armored Mandalorian with younglings.",

I trained with many masters, learned different aspects of the force and to look at things differently.”**  He paused as he looked out the viewport once again.  **”But perhaps the biggest difference was the open encouragement of relationships and family within.   It was a stark contrast from the Main Order.”**  He took a sharp inhale and let it out.  The memory of Marina walking down the gangplank was a powerful and lasting memory.  One he still regretted to this day.  That he didn’t fight to let the order keep them together.  To let them both go to the Altisian Sect.  He still believed to this day that bond they shared was the issue.   **”Things would have been different if the Order would have let us go there together but…”** He stopped and shook his head.  He couldn’t change the past.  He looked back to Nadia and saw her watching and listening intently.",

That would make things more interesting. ** ”In fact, why don’t we up the stakes?  Instead of waiting for the game to be over to ask our questions, we can ask them after the other player loses a piece.”**  She glanced at Vaeros to see if he\u0027d agree.\n\n**“And it’s not that I am so good at sneaking up on people, though I am,”** Iyola continued. **“It’s that you don’t pay attention.  Like now. “ ** She moved the Kintan into her Savrip, bumping it directly into the Houjix.  The green-lit lizard-beast grabbed the Houjix and tore it in half with its powerful jaws.  The Houjix flickered, then disappeared. \n\n**“Ha!”**  Iyola looked at Vaeros expectantly.

It\u0027s a curiosity, a filling-in of a gap in her historical knowledge. But as Wes speaks of family, of relationships being openly encouraged, a subtle shift occurs. The wall of stoic neutrality she maintains so carefully develops a hairline fracture.\n\n\nWhen he trails off, the weight of his unspoken \"but...\" hangs heavy in the air. The sudden, sharp spike of his regret, a raw and powerful emotion, cuts through her own carefully constructed defenses. She feels it not as a thought, but as a physical sensation—a sudden, aching pang of profound loss that resonates deep in her own chest. It\u0027s not her pain, but it feels hauntingly familiar.\n\n\nShe tilts her head slightly, her gaze analytical but not unkind. **\"Us?\"** she asks softly, the single word a quiet invitation for him to continue, but with no pressure behind it. She doesn\u0027t pry, but she has clearly identified the heart of his pain.",

It seemed to have resonated with her somehow as he spoke his memories of Marina came back with an unwanted reality.  He couldn’t sense her anymore. What had always been a comforting reality, even if they weren’t together, he knew she was alive and well.  Nadia’s question of ‘us’ wasn’t lost on him.  She gave him an opportunity to continue.  While he never really spoke of her to anyone he felt like telling her.  \n\n\nHe nodded.   **”Yes, ‘us’”**  He paused slightly as he sat up a bit straighter.  **”I was sent on a mission to some backwater separatist system to deliver some intel to the republic operative there.  Like always, nothing is ever as it seems and we got mixed up in planetary politics and shady dealings.”**\n\n\nHe took a breath and looked at Nadia. Like before he felt that sense of familiarity and he had no context to understand why.  It was going to eat at him until he figured it out but that wasn’t going to happen right now, If ever.  **”What we didn’t expect or plan for was what happened between us.  Who would have thought a Mandalorian and a Jedi Padawan would fall for each other.”**  He looked Nadia in the eyes and he saw the shade of blue they held.  Something tickled the back of his mind but he dismissed it as he kept talking. **”She opened my eyes and mind to the Force.  Then something else formed and I believe that’s why the Order separated us.”**",

She offers no judgment, no pity, only the silent, steady attention of a fellow soldier hearing a painful after-action report. The names, the places—Fakir, the *Arms Akimbo*—mean nothing to her, but the story is universal. A plan. A promise. A future stolen by the chaos of war and the changes of a galaxy turned against them.\n\nShe feels the raw emotions radiating from him—the love, the profound regret, the sharp edge of anger. Her own empathic senses, still raw and open, sting with the intensity of his feelings. It\u0027s a painful, disorienting echo. For a fleeting, confusing moment, the image of a woman\u0027s face flashes through her mind—brown hair, piercing blue eyes like her own—accompanied by a wave of love and loss so powerful she mistakes it for his, or perhaps her own grief for Derek. She flinches, almost imperceptibly, and subtly erects a mental wall, not to shut him out, but to protect herself from the overwhelming bleed-through of his pain.\n\nShe says nothing for a long moment after he finishes, letting the silence of the galley settle around his words.\n\n**\"The war... it took from everyone,\"** she says finally, her voice a low, somber murmur. It is a simple, profound truth, offered not as comfort, but as a shared acknowledgment of a galaxy built on ruins. She looks at the lightsaber hilt still clipped to his belt, and then down at her own. **\"Some of us just have more... reminders than others.\"**",

With a controlled breath his chest rose and fell and his own defenses were put back into place.  He hadn’t intended to overload her, especially right after going through her own ordeal.   \n\n\nThey sat in silence both taking care with their emotions.  When she did speak her words rang true.   The war took from them all.  For some it took everything, others little.  For the lucky few nothing.  He saw her look at the lightsabers they both carried and spoke of reminders.  He nodded as there was one reminder he always had and now it was gone.  \n\n\n**”The one reminder that we both shared was the bond that formed between us.  We could always sense her no matter the distance.  From one side of the galaxy to the other.  The distance affected the clarity of what we could sense r but we knew the other was alive.  Still separated by the after effects of the war and then the Empire.”**  \n\n\nHe stood taking a step back and then turned towards the water dispenser.  **”Even Eve with her database of information has nothing on her.  It all ends after Order 66.  I wouldn’t be surprised if she had something to do with that.   Despite her Jedi training she was very technically oriented.”**",

A visible tremor runs through her hand as she rests it on the table. The carefully constructed walls she has been erecting since waking are starting to crack under the strain of memory, grief, and the profound, bone-deep exhaustion of her ordeal.\n\nShe presses her lips together, fighting for control, but a wave of dizziness washes over her, forcing her to grip the edge of the table to steady herself.

They must be doing something right to still be in operation.”**  She gave a small smile and nodded at his comment continuing without break.\n \n \nWhat she said about Cloud City and Bespin matched up with what he knew of it in the relatively short time he spent there.  He then noticed something.  Maybe he felt something as well as he noticed her voice begin to waver.  Her hand seemed to push against the table as if to steady herself.   He was already pushing off the counter when he saw her color fade as she worked to steady herself.  \n\n\nMoving quicker than it would seem possible, Wes hurried to the table where they sat.    It either spoke to the craftsmanship of his Beskar’gam or that he wore it like a second skin that he moved as if unencumbered.  **“Hey, stay seated, don\u0027t stand up.”**  He said gently yet firmly as he laid a hand on her shoulder.  It was then that it was reaffirmed that she was still weak and needed some rest.   While the talk and food were good, rest was still the priority.",

It\u0027s a pure, instinctual reaction, the muscle memory of a captive bracing for a blow.\n\nBut the blow doesn\u0027t come. The hand on her shoulder is firm, but steady, not cruel. It doesn\u0027t shove or grip; it guides. The wave of panic recedes as quickly as it came, leaving behind only the dizzying, profound weakness that caused her to falter.\n\nThe strength drains from her legs. She doesn\u0027t fight his guidance, but instead allows him to gently push her back down into the chair, slumping into it with a weary sigh. She closes her eyes for a moment, the simple act of sitting an immense relief.\n\n**\"I\u0027m... fine,\"** she lies, her voice a thin, unconvincing whisper. **\"Just... tired.\"**",

She can enter a healing trance and use the Force to help accelerate her healing.”**  Looking at her he could see the relief in her eyes and feel it in the Force.  **”And to make sure she comes along alright she can come to the Medbay when she wakes for a quick checkup and not have to stay an extended amount of time.”**  He didn’t ask if that was acceptable or the best course as that was going to be the plan anyways.

She looks up at Wes, her eyes conveying a gratitude that she cannot yet put into words. The simple act of him understanding her unspoken fear, of advocating for her comfort over cold efficiency, is a more potent balm than any nutrient paste.\n\nShe takes the offered glass of water, her hand steadier now, and takes a long, slow drink. It is the first decision she has made that feels entirely her own since waking.\n\nAfter finishing most of the water, Nadia sets the cup down with a soft click. The small act seems to center her. She looks up at Wes, her gaze clear and direct. The exhaustion is still etched on her features, a deep weariness in her bones, but the cornered-animal terror is gone, replaced by a quiet resolve.\n\n**\"Thank you,\"** she says, the words simple but imbued with a sincere, weary gratitude. **\"The barracks. I think... I\u0027m ready.\"**\n\nShe pushes herself to her feet, slowly this time, her movements deliberate and controlled. She is still unsteady, but she does not waver. Leaning only slightly on the table for support, she stands, ready to follow him, ready for the simple, profound relief of a quiet room and a place to rest.",

The Kintan unfurled its razor-edged tentacles and seized the Savrip, which shuddered in anger and pain. The Savrip had enough defense to last another turn, but the grapple action from the Kintan would prevent her from moving the Savrip, and she’d lose the piece next turn unless Vaeros moved the Kintan or she took the Kintan.  *It was annoying.*  She pushed the Bulbous over, which began to exude its noxious gas.",

It had been replaced with a weariness he has seen in her features from earlier.   Despite the care she had received in the Medbay from Eve she was still weak and under nourished.  He reminded himself that he had Eve wake her early so her mind had the chance to recover alongside and with her body.   \n\n\nAfter taking it slow and standing she paused.  After a few seconds when she knew she was good he saw her nod and say she was ready.  With a smile and a nod of his own he picked up his helmet and motioned towards the galley doors.  **”This way Nadia and you\u0027re in luck.  The barracks are right outside the galley.   You don’t have far to go.”**  He felt the relief in her emotions as she began to walk for the door.  He directed her to the side that Vaeros was not in.   It wasn’t because of what the man was and supported but she had been through enough and rest was what she needed.  Not potential confrontation.  \n\n\n**”This way.  There’s latrines and bunks on both sides.”** He said as he led her into a crew quarters area.  **”Anyone that’s free you can claim and I’ll let the others know that you’re in here.”**  He paused for a moment as he wrangled with this next question but asked anyway.  **\"Do you have the strength to enter a healing trance?”**",

Vaeros was falling into a classic trap, though it would require her to sacrifice the Savrip.  But she had the Grimtaash too, so that would suffice. \nShe moves her green Kintan into the yellow, bumping it within range of the Grimtaash and next to the Houjix.  The Grimtaash awaits within two spaces.  This would force Vaeros to either release the Savrip - though it wouldn’t be able to do anything else on its turn - or move to attack one of her other nearby pieces, both of which could withstand a Ghhhk attack and counter with a kill.  \n\n**“The Savrip dies at the end of your turn, unless you release it,” **she informed him. \n\nShe glanced over at Varda, who was merrily whittling something.  **“Varda, I’m curious.  I heard you speaking Mando’a earlier.  Are you a Mandalorian?”**  In all honesty, Varda did not strike her as a typical Mandalorian - she was certainly tough enough, but she lacked the grimly standoffish demeanor that so many of them had towards *aruetiise*, outsiders.",

Trying to find that kind of peace... that kind of control... it\u0027s beyond me. Not yet.\"**\n\nShe moves to her chosen bunk and sinks down onto its edge, the sheer weight of her physical and emotional exhaustion finally settling over her.\n\n**\"I just need to sleep,\"** she says, her voice barely audible. **\"Just... a real sleep.\"**",

Despite being removed from the hell she was in training and instinct was winning out on being safe. \n\n\nHer answer to his question before sitting on the bunk had him wondering if he should offer to help.  It meant having a higher level of trust with each other and despite the good start he wasn’t sure she trusted him enough just yet.  \n\n\n**”Nadia if you can’t sleep and maybe want help finding a way through that storm to reach a healing trance let me know.  Have Eve find me.”**  He gave her a nod, having put the ball in her court.   This gave her the decision to ask for help instead of having it thrust upon her.   **“I’ll be with the others for a bit.  Sleep well.”**",

She gives a single, slow nod, an acknowledgment of the offer and the trust it implies. It is a promise of a conversation for another time.\n\nWes gives her a final nod and turns, his armored form disappearing through the doorway, leaving her alone in the quiet of the empty barracks.\n\nNadia watches him go, the silence settling around her once more. She reaches out and pulls the thin partition across the entrance to her alcove, the soft slide of the panel sealing her away from the rest of the ship. In the dim, isolated privacy of her bunk, she finally allows her shoulders to slump, the heavy weight of her ordeal pressing down on her. She curls up on the thin mattress pad, her back to the wall, and closes her eyes, seeking not a healing trance or a connection to the Force, but the simple, profound oblivion of a long and dreamless sleep.\n\n~~---------------------~~\n\nEnd scene",

He seemed to be pretty smart, so she couldn’t underestimate him. He seemed satisfied with the move, at least. Well, she wouldn’t have to lose that Kintan, at least not yet.\n\nHis comment baffled her.  If a mere dejarik board was visually overwhelming to him, she couldn’t imagine how grim his daily life in his time must have been.  *Were things really that bad in this time?*\n\nVaeros then compared the spectacle of the game to an older person watching a  long-running holoshow.  She didn’t quite grasp the metaphor; maybe he was like a person who didn’t want to look at new things?  No, she must have misunderstood; that would be a really odd view from an explorer’s point of view.\n\nBasically, Vaeros was strange to her, maybe the strangest one here in a strange bunch.   *Fortunately,  I like strange things. *\n\nShe moves the Grimtaash forward, which takes a swipe at the Ghhhk, tearing the bird-creature’s head off.  It flickers and goes black.\n\n**“I mean, if you’re getting overwhelmed visually, we can pause the game and come back to it,”** Iyola says.  **“Or we can start with standard dejarik next time.”**\n\nThat said, she has another question to ask, even if they pause the game for now.  **“What was on that white cube you found on the slave ship?”** she asks him.",

Nadia’s sleeping after her ordeal; Del-Fin also mentions that she didn’t want to be near the body of her friend, Derek.\n\n**“Yeah, and probably that prisoner in the brig next to the medbay has woken up by now,” I**yola points out.  **“He’ll probably be loud and not too happy.” **\n\nDel-Fin asks about the dejarik game.  **“Oh, we were just wrapping up,” ** she said.** “Technically I won, because Vaeros conceded, but it was his first dejarik game ever, and he did a great job.” **\n\n**“Did you happen to see Misha in the crew quarters?**”  she asked Del-Fin.  **“Just want to make sure she’s OK too.”**",

And that specific agents, whatever that meant, could be given protector status after some tests were done.  It all made little sense which wasn’t surprising.  \n\n\nShe shifted her talk to getting to Bespin to find out more answers.  He nodded as she asked him about his clan name and his first name.   He gave her a small smile.  **”Wes, is my name.   Del-Fin is my clan\u0027s name as well as my surname.  My father led the clan.”**",

The Clone wars did much to split alliances between the clans.  Some just decided to go alone.   It didn’t mean Del-Fin didn’t have allies.   They worked and supported several.  Before the fall of the Republic he could remember talk of starting relations with Clan Skirata but it never happened.  With the Empire hunting him it wasn’t surprising that many clans kept their distance even after his father and others escaped Raxus Prime.   **”Not really, many alliances and houses were broken apart with the start of the war.  That’s not to say that it didn’t create new alliances.   We were about to start talking with another clan but Order 66 happened.”**\n\n\nHis mentioning of war again seemed to stop further questions as Iyola shifted to what she wanted when they got to Bespin.  He smiled as she began rattling off things she wanted.   Some of them sounded good.   Especially the coffee maker.  **”Coffee sounds good and information.  Hopefully Nadia’s uncle can help with both.”**",

The ship\u0027s main lighting is steady and bright now, chasing away the ghostly emergency strobes and revealing the stark, utilitarian design of the vessel. Every wall is the same neutral grey, every door identical. Without her datapad\u0027s map, navigating this place would be a disorienting nightmare.\n\nShe follows the blue, glowing path on her screen, her boots making a soft, solitary rhythm on the deck plating. The route takes her deeper into the ship\u0027s spine, toward the areas marked \u0027Engineering\u0027 and \u0027Navigation\u0027. The air here feels different, heavier, charged with the low, powerful hum of the ship\u0027s awakening heart.\n\nShe arrives at a junction. To her right, a heavy, shielded door blocking a ladder access down is marked with a complex schematic of a power core. **[ENGINEERING]**. Staight ahead, another door bears a stylized star-chart symbol. **[BRIDGE]**.",

The sterile, anonymous corridors of the *Venture* offer no comfort, only a stark reminder of his isolation. He makes his way back to the starboard barracks, the door hissing open to reveal the silent, ordered space. He nods curtly to Dryzan, who is just emerging from his own alcove, likely on his way to the galley, and continues to his own partitioned bunk.\n\nHe draws the partition closed, the soft slide of the panel granting him a small measure of privacy. He sits on the edge of the sterile bunk, the silence of the room a stark contrast to the dissonant hum of his own fractured connection to the Force.\n\nIt\u0027s then that he feels it again.\n\nIt is not a thought or a sound, but a distinct, psychic \"pull\" from the pocket where he stowed the strange, white crystalline datacron. It is a quiet, insistent hum, a clean, orderly note calling out from amidst the chaos of his own senses. It seems to resonate with the very silence of the room, promising order, promising knowledge. It is a puzzle waiting to be solved, a thread waiting to be pulled.",

Unlike the bustling command centers of the Republic vessels she\u0027s seen, this place is designed for quiet contemplation. A single, central command chair dominates the room, offering a perfect, unobstructed view through the massive panoramic viewport that forms the forward wall.\n\nThrough it, the view is spectacular. The *Venture* has shifted its orientation slightly, and now the colossal white-gold sphere of the Kinooine sun fills the left side of the viewport, its brilliant light glinting off the immense, deployed solar collectors. The rest of the view is an endless spray of diamond-dust stars on a canvas of absolute black.\n\nThe consoles are dark, featureless slabs of obsidian-like material, free of the chaotic clutter of physical buttons and switches. The only illumination comes from the soft, ambient glow of the floor panels and a serene, three-dimensional holographic star chart floating in the center of the room, a tiny, glowing icon of the *Venture* hanging silently in its orbit.",

A complex web of massive power conduits, thick as a Wookiee\u0027s arm, snakes out from the core, running up the walls and disappearing into the ceiling.\n\nThe air is hot and filled with the thrum of immense, contained energy. Walkways and ladders crisscross the space, providing access to various control terminals and maintenance junctions, most of which are currently dark. The sheer scale and complexity of the machinery are staggering.\n\nLike the workshop, the space is impeccably clean, scrubbed of any personal effects or loose tools. However, the signs of long-term wear are more evident here. On a large conduit directly across from the ladder, Iyola can see it: a cluster of small but deep pits and scoring marks, the tell-tale signs of micrometeoroid impacts that have breached the outer hull and scarred the vital systems within. It is a clear, physical reminder of the ship\u0027s vulnerability and the long, silent journey it has endured.",

This object is too perfect, too structured.\n*It is not Sith.* It lacks the sharp, aggressive angles and the resonant whispers of the dark side that even the most ancient Sith artifacts possess. This object feels… neutral. Coldly, perfectly neutral.\n*It is not Rakatan or Celestial.* The energy signature does not match the overwhelming power profiles of those ancient, god-like civilizations.\n\nThe conclusion is as clear as it is unsettling. This is something else entirely. It is a product of a Force tradition that developed in complete, monastic isolation, or one that is so ancient it predates the schisms that defined all known galactic history. Its creators were not conquerors or saviors in the traditional sense.\n\nWith a sudden, chilling certainty, Vaeros knows that any attempt to open it with a simple display of Light or Dark Side power would be a fool\u0027s errand. The key to this lock is not power, but understanding. He has successfully identified the nature of the problem, the first and most crucial step in solving any puzzle.",

But there was one nagging question.\n\n**“Eve,”**  Iyola said,** “earlier you told me that we had to avoid Imperial patrols.  Are you - are we -  rebels?  Or criminals?  Or both? Or are the Protectors?  Why would we have to avoid the government otherwise?”**\n\nThey likely had a few hours before Bespin.  Iyola had some time - and a lot to catch up on.  **“In the meantime, can you send me what you have on Cloud City’s layout and businesses and government and anything else you have?  Oh, and maybe some sources on what’s happened in the galaxy in the past 200 years or so?”**\n\nWith that, Iyola started to head out.  She intended to return to her cubicle, do some reading, and maybe swipe a few more pillows that weren’t being used.",

He sends a probe of pure, uncolored Force energy toward the crystalline lattice, a delicate, surgical incursion of his will.\n\nThe moment his probe touches the artifact, the static hum of his own Shattered Focus roars in his mind, threatening to overwhelm him. The datacron\u0027s clean, orderly resonance and his own fractured connection are like a perfectly tuned instrument being played next to a screaming feedback loop. For a moment, the psychic dissonance is agonizing.\n\nBut he pushes through it.\n\nBeyond the pain, he senses the lock. It is not a series of tumblers or an energy gate. It is a conceptual barrier, a \"gatekeeper\" of pure logic. It is not waiting for a command, a password, or a demonstration of power. It is waiting for a specific *philosophical resonance*. The device is designed to open not for the strongest or the most worthy, but for a mind that can prove it understands the fundamental principles upon which it was built. It is a lock that requires a key of pure intellect and understanding.",

The engineering bay, with its thrumming heart and scarred conduits, has offered up its immediate secrets. It is a place of future work, not present answers.\n\nShe makes her way back up the ladder and through the silent, steadily lit corridors, her mind reeling with impossible histories and an uncertain future. The ship no longer feels just empty; it feels ancient, a vessel adrift in a sea of time it was never meant to navigate.\n\nThe door to the port-side barracks hisses open. The large, central \"Crew Lead\" alcove is hers, a small island of claimed territory. The partitions for Dryzan\u0027s and Vaeros\u0027s bunks are drawn, marking their private spaces. The other three alcoves remain stark and empty.\n\nIn the center of the common area, however, someone else is now awake.\n\nMisha is sitting on the edge of one of the unclaimed bunks, looking small and lost in the sterile grey room. She has changed out of her grimy technician\u0027s jumpsuit and into a set of the same simple, grey shipboard fatigues, likely taken from a spare locker. Her hair is still damp, probably from using the sonic cleanser in the fresher unit. She is just sitting there, her hands clasped tightly in her lap, staring at the metallic floor with wide, haunted eyes, a lone survivor marooned on a strange and silent shore.",

Hi,\"** she says, her voice small and hesitant. **\"I... I slept okay. It\u0027s... quiet.\"**\n\nShe smooths a non-existent wrinkle on the leg of her grey fatigues, avoiding eye contact for a moment before looking back up at Iyola.\n\n**\"I\u0027m from Imperial Center... from Coruscant,\"** she says, the words sounding strange even to her own ears now. **\"I just... I just graduated from the technical academy. This was supposed to be my first real job.\"** A bitter, humorless smile touches her lips for a fraction of a second. **\"Guess I should have read the fine print.\"**",

She swallowed hard and gathered herself.\n\nShe thought  about what Eve had said about avoiding Imperial patrols. ** “I don’t think the ship is going to Coruscant any time soon,”** she told Misha. **“But apparently, Bespin is still a big tourist  and  gas mining planet. I’m sure you can get a ride to Coruscant, or wherever you’re going.” **\n\nIyola tried to reassure her when the other woman expressed dismay over her recent time on the *Aether. * **“I know what you mean.  I trained so long for the SurveyCorps, and then I left in a year because it wasn’t for me.  I think it’s normal to have to change your job a few times.”** *Though accidentally working for pirates was probably less normal.*  “**What do you think you’ll do next?” **",

Nineteen years ago.\"**\n\nShe shakes her head, looking down at her hands again, unable to process the sheer scale of what Iyola is telling her. The idea of getting a ride back to Coruscant suddenly seems like a childish fantasy.\n\n**\"What will I do next?\"** she echoes, her voice barely a whisper. She lets out a short, sharp, humorless laugh. **\"I don\u0027t know. A week ago, I had a plan. Graduate, get a good berth on a corporate freighter, maybe work my way up to chief engineer. Now...\"**\n\n**\"I don\u0027t know,\"** she whispers, her voice barely audible. **\"Go back to Coruscant? What am I going to tell them? \u0027Sorry I\u0027m late, I got accidentally press-ganged by a slaver crew who were then defeated by a group of ancient warriors who appeared out of nowhere\u0027?\"**\n\nShe lets out a short, bitter laugh.\n\n**\"They\u0027ll think I\u0027m insane. Or a liar. And... Rask has all my chain codes, my credentials... he\u0027s probably already flagged me as a pirate myself, a deserter, to cover his tracks.\"**\n\nShe looks up at Iyola, her eyes wide with a quiet, dawning horror. **\"I don\u0027t...

My name on his crew manifest. My comm signal broadcasting from his ship. To them, I\u0027m an accomplice. It\u0027s easier that way.\"**\n\nThe offer to stay, however, seems to land with a surprising weight. The idea of having a purpose, of doing the one thing she\u0027s actually good at, is a small, solid piece of ground in the swirling chaos of her new reality.\n\n**\"I... yeah,\"** she says, the words slow and uncertain. **\"Yeah, I can do that. I can help. I\u0027m... I\u0027m good with power converters and motivator assemblies.\"**\n\nAt Iyola\u0027s final question, Misha blinks, the query so fundamental it\u0027s like being asked \"what\u0027s a blaster?\"\n\n**\"A chain code?\"** she repeats, a note of genuine surprise in her voice. **\"It\u0027s... it\u0027s everything. It\u0027s your galactic ID. Your travel history, your financial records, your criminal record, your Imperial loyalty rating... everything is linked to it. It\u0027s a string of data that follows you from birth to death. Without a clean, active chain code, you can\u0027t get a legitimate job, you can\u0027t pass through a military checkpoint, you can\u0027t even buy a ticket on a public transport. You... you don\u0027t exist, officially. You\u0027re a ghost.\"**",

For the first time, she\u0027s not the most lost person in the room.\n\n**\"Make one?\"** Misha shakes her head, a grim smile on her lips. **\"You can\u0027t just make a chain code. They\u0027re issued by the Empire, tied to your biometric data, your homeworld\u0027s census... forging one, a good one that will pass a real ISB scan? That takes a master slicer, military-grade encryption keys, and a whole lot of luck. It\u0027s not something you can just buy.\"**\n\nShe sees the look on Iyola\u0027s face, the dawning realization of what it means to be a non-person in this new, orderly galaxy.\n\n**\"Yeah,\"** Misha says softly, her voice losing its bitter edge and taking on a quiet, shared melancholy. **\"I guess we both are.\"**\n\nThe heavy silence hangs between them for a moment, the shared weight of their impossible situations. Misha looks away, breaking the intensity of the moment. She clears her throat, deliberately shifting the topic to something more tangible, more technical—a problem she can understand.\n\n**\"So,\"** she says, her voice quiet but regaining a bit of its professional focus. **\"Eve said there are maintenance droids on board, but they\u0027re all offline. If we\u0027re going to get this ship running properly, that\u0027s probably where we should start. Even if we get the parts on Bespin, we\u0027ll need the extra hands to install them.\"** She looks back at Iyola, a flicker of her old, capable self returning. **\"Do you know where the droid bay is?\"**",

You have friends here.  We’ll figure it out.” **\n\n*Was she trying to convince MIsha, or herself?* \n\nAfter Misha left, Iyola went to the other bunks and collected a few more pillows. Then she visited the cleaners, sighing as she saw the basic condition of the facilities.   *Looks like the base camp on Abafar. *She mentally added scented bubbling soap and hair wash to her Bespin shopping list.  \n\nShe undressed and stood in the cleaners, feeling the vibrations weakly scrub away the misting water.  Her mind turned back to her situation.\n\n*I don’t have my friends or my family with me.  Or my Caz.  I don’t have anything I’ve worked for. The galaxy is a nightmare. I don’t exist here, and I can’t.*\n\nShe started to sob.  At least the cleaners were a good place to do that.  She slumped to the ground, letting her tears fall amidst the trickles of recycled water.  The vibrations were weak.  *Eve was probably trying to conserve power here too.  *\n\nIyola finally gathered herself.  She was used to rescuing herself, and she’d just have to do it again.  She dressed, squeezing the moisture out of her hair first, and headed back to her cubicle.  After creating a pile of pillows on her bed, she leaned against it and started to study Bespin.",

The steady rhythm focuses her more surely than any meditation.\n\nShe breathes with the air around her, letting her mood guide the blade. The act is familiar, comforting—a small ritual in dark times. Yet the sparks of life she once felt within the grand weave of the Force are muted, dulled. That loss pierces deeper than any blade. It is like walking once through a royal orchard, trees stretching endlessly in bloom, only to return and find a single, withered tree struggling to live.\n\nThe knife slips. She hisses as the edge bites her finger, pausing only a moment before pressing on. She always presses on. She always has, and always will.\n\nAt last she leans back, the piece complete, and a faint smile touches her lips at the sight of the small wooden owl.\n\nThe hum of her compatriots has disappeared and she looks up and frowns. Her attentiveness is usually enough to feel people move. By the goddess she truly is out of sorts. \n\nShe smiles at Wes. **\"Ahh apologies, I seemed to have been a bit out of sorts for a moment there\"**",

Misha finds a new purpose in the silent heart of Engineering, stabilizing the ship\u0027s power grid. Vaeros sequesters himself, probing the mysteries of the white datacron until he is met by a final, conceptual barrier his knowledge cannot yet breach. Iyola pores over the ship\u0027s archives, absorbing two centuries of lost history, the name Bespin becoming a focal point, a tangible next step. Nadia, after a quiet conversation with Misha, makes a pragmatic choice and submits to another five hours of regenerative stasis, seeking to prepare herself for the challenges ahead.\n\nFinally, the time is up. The massive solar collectors fold into the hull with a whisper of hydraulics. The deep, resonant hum of the hyperdrive once again fills the ship, and the journey begins—a series of short, precise jumps through the galaxy\u0027s back channels. After nearly six hours of travel, a final, gentle shift in the ship\u0027s vibration signals their arrival.",

Floating serenely in its upper atmosphere is the shining disc of Cloud City.\n\nJust as the announcement concludes, the doors to the medbay hiss open. Nadia Skirata steps out.

        "content":  "Vaeros marshals his thoughts, drawing upon every obscure text and forgotten historical footnote he has ever consumed. He formulates a hypothesis, a philosophical key, and projects it at the datacron\u0027s conceptual lock.\n\nFor a moment, there is nothing. Then, the datacron\u0027s internal hum intensifies, not with the resonance of acceptance, but with the jarring, discordant buzz of an incorrect answer. The pure, orderly energy of the artifact rejects his logic. A spike of psychic feedback, cold and sharp, lances through his mind, forcing him to pull back with a grimace of pain.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle eludes him. He has identified the lock, he understands its nature, but the specific philosophy of its creators remains a frustrating, maddening enigma. The datacron falls silent once more, its secrets still safely locked away, waiting for a key he does not yet possess. The path forward is not one of deduction, but of discovery.",

The scene before him is one of quiet, fragile aftermath.\n\nHe sees Nadia and Misha sitting at one of the far tables, silhouetted against the brilliant, burning star in the viewport. Misha isn\u0027t eating; she is simply watching Nadia with a look of profound, helpless empathy.\n\nNadia is the center of the room\u0027s unspoken weight. She is pale, her face visibly tear-streaked, though the storm of her grief has clearly passed. Her expression is utterly vacant, hollowed out. Her gaze is fixed on the table in front of her, seeing nothing. Her hand, trembling almost imperceptibly, lifts a cup of water to her lips. She sips, her movements slow and mechanical, as if the simple act requires all of her remaining concentration.\n\nWes has no context for what has just transpired, no knowledge of the breakdown or the quiet offering of comfort. He sees only the result: a young woman who looks as if her spirit has just been scoured clean, and another who seems to have no idea what to do next.\n\nWes Del-Fin (@yogi_001)",

The images brought Wes back to when he first arrived here to join the Altisian Jedi aboard the Chu’unthor.  It was a time of happiness and sorrow for him.  Happy to begin his training and sorrow that the Order had decided to separate him from the woman he was in love with.    \n\n\nThe telltale sounds of heavy boots on the deck plating told him someone was coming.  Opening his senses up he felt the presence of Nadia coming closer.   As she entered he turned his head.   It was a pleasant surprise to see her in her armor.  The look on her face matched the calm he felt through the Force.  He gave her a small smile and a nod as she spoke to Eve.  **”I’ll wait for the response and take us in.  Eve, you may want to dock us.   Flying this boat is one thing but docking this thing the first time out.    Well I don’t want to scratch your paint.”**  He said with a smile as his hands waited at the controls.",

Stepping through the threshold into the galley he saw that it was empty except for the two new crew members.   Nadia and Misha were seated in the far corner.  There was a seriousness in the air and between the two women there were looks of being lost, unsure and not knowing what to do.    \n\n\nHe nodded at Misha who looked up as he entered.  With a quick nod at the paste and water dispensers he grabbed a drink before walking over to the table that was shared by the two women who had just shared an ordeal.  Terror at the hands of the slavers and the death of a friend.  He couldn’t personally speak to the horrors of the first but the second he was well versed.  \n\n\nClosing on the table he could see the far off look that Nadia held and the questioning one Misha did little to hide.  **”I’d ask how you two were doing but I have a feeling I might have an idea of the answer.”**  He paused for a second and gestured to their table.  **”May I join you?”**",

He had data... old Republic survey charts, energy signature analysis... He even had this other thing he was obsessed with for a few days. It was some weird, milky-white crystal artifact. He was convinced it was part of the puzzle, a key or a map. He spent days trying to get it to open, but he couldn\u0027t crack it. Finally, he got furious, called it worthless junk, and had one of the thugs toss it in a salvage locker.\"**",

He wanted her to feel that she was a part of this, not the cause.  \n\n\nHe waited as he saw her furrow her brow.  It looked like she was trying to remember something. He had been getting information on where to look.  But who would know where to look for them?  Only one answer came to mind.  These ‘Protectors’ that Eve mentioned.   When she mentioned an artifact he raised an eyebrow.  That he couldn’t open it by any means available to him made him think of something Force related.   But how he came to have it and who gave it to him was yet another mystery.  This one thought raised his curiosity.  **”What did it look like?  Size and shape?  Did this milky white appearance shift and move as if on its own accord?  Here’s maybe the more important question.  What was Rask to do with this ship and its cargo, and I mean the five of us that were in cryo, when he took it over?”**",

This ‘Protector\u0027s Purpose’ is something new.”**  His gaze passed between the three women.\n\n\nHis voice took on an edge.  **”The five of us, if you want to look at it this way, were the treasure on this ship.  These Protectors put the five of us here for some unknown reason that only they know.  I for one would like to know how.   More importantly why.   Why take us from where we were away from friends, family,”**  His fist tightened but only Nadia could feel the rising anger within.  **”And those we loved.”**",

He might have a clue.  *I\u0027m going to search this ship again.  After we leave Bespin, maybe.*\n\nWhen Wes shared his theory about the treasures, she looked at him askance. ** “You really think we’re all special?  Maybe you are, you’re a Mandalorian. Maybe Vaeros and Varda are, they’re - whatever they are.  But why me?  I can’t even remember what happened, I just know that I - pushed my  luck on something, and it came back to bite me, real bad.”**\n\nShe stood up to leave.  “**What makes me worth keeping on ice two hundred and thirty kriffing years?”** \n\nIyola waved her hand at Wes. **“This sucks for all of us.  But maybe your parents are still alive. Maybe you still have family and friends out there. What’s it been for you, a decade?  Your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever you had, your riduur, maybe they’re still alive.  I\u0027m a ghost.” **She belatedly realized  that Wes  didn’t have a partner, since he was not just a Mandalorian but also a Jedi. *Oops.*  She took a deep, shuddering breath.\n\n**“I’m going back to my bunk to get my stuff.”**",

Her face, already pale from her ordeal, loses another shade of color, the fragile composure she\u0027s managed to build threatening to crumble.\n\nNadia, with immense effort, takes a slow, shaky breath, fighting for control. She glances at Wes, then to Misha, then back at Wes again, her eyes wide and haunted. She pushes away her own rising terror.\n\n**\"Rask... he found Derek\u0027s research files,\"** she rasps, her voice thin but steady, a desperate attempt to regain control of the narrative. **\"Old Republic project notes. About the *Venture*.\"** She struggles to recall the specifics, like a drowning person to a piece of driftwood. **\"It was a deep-space research vessel. A mobile archive. He romanticized the terms in the old files. \u0027Protectors\u0027... he thought they meant treasure. A hidden vault. The Protectors were just a code name for the archivists. There was nothing in the records to indicate there would br people here.\"**\n\nShe forces herself to meet Wes\u0027s gaze. **\"We were just... just trying to find it before the Empire did.**",

Her lashing out at him was understandable.   \n\n**”Iyola.”** He said her name gently to get her to stop.   **”I didn’t mean to come off that way.  We’re all a little frustrated.”**  He saw the look in her eyes and he nodded.  **”A lot of frustration.”**  He corrected himself.   **”The person I care about the most in this changed galaxy was alive when something happened to me.  I don’t know what that was but I woke up with a lightsaber wound right here.”**  He tapped his armor that covered the scar.   **”I don’t know how that got there.  What I do know is that the woman I care about, I can’t feel in the Force anymore.  We could feel each other no matter the distance.  That leads me to a conclusion that shakes me to my core.”** \n\n\nHe became quiet for a moment and Nadia spoke up attempting to explain the search for the *Venture* and how the Protectors were archivists.   It didn’t sit right with him.  How did the five of them become intermingled with archivists?   Not to mention what Eve had already said.
