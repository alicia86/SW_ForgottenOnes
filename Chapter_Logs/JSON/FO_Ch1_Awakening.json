The tyrannical GALACTIC EMPIRE tightens its grip, its vast war machine seeking to crush the last embers of freedom. Against this overwhelming might, a fledgling REBELLION fights a desperate shadow war, their hope dwindling with each passing day.\nBut this is not the first time the galaxy has been torn asunder. Across millennia, great powers have risen and fallen, their histories rewritten by the victors and their truths lost to time. Whispers persist of a hidden conflict fought not for territory, but for the soul of history itself.\nNow, in a forgotten corner of the Outer Rim, an ancient vessel, long thought lost, drifts silently. Aboard the ghost ship VENTURE, a cryptic emergency protocol has been triggered, awakening a handful of souls ripped from their own eras—survivors of conflicts long past, preserved for a purpose they do not understand, and about to be thrust into a war that is not their own….",

For a moment, Wes is adrift in a calm, cold void, a feeling of disconnection so complete it steals his breath. He instinctively reaches out with his senses, not his ears or eyes, but with the part of him that his master, Chase Davion, had helped him nurture. He feels the thrum of a distant power source, the cold metal of an enclosure, and a deep, oppressive stillness.\n\nThen, the physical world crashes in. The weakness in his limbs, the sluggish pound of his own heart, and the stale, musty air filling his lungs. He opens his eyes and finds only blackness, a disorienting void that his helmet\u0027s HUD should have instantly illuminated. The lack of his helmet is the first violation.\n\nHe is enclosed, his bare shoulders brushing against the smooth, curved wall of a tube. As he pushes himself up, his muscles scream in protest. A sharp, phantom pain pulls at his abdomen, an echo of a wound he can’t remember. A slow, methodical search confirms the final indignity: his armor, his blaster, his entire identity is gone. He is blind, weak, and stripped bare, left with nothing but a warrior\u0027s discipline and a connection to the Force that feels as broken and wrong as everything else.",

His limbs are heavy, useless things, and a wracking cough echoes in the tight space he finds himself in. He tries to open his eyes, but the world remains a dizzying, pitch-black void.\n\nPanic, cold and sharp, begins to set in. He pushes out, his bare hands meeting the smooth, curved walls of some kind of tube. Where are his clothes? His coat? His blaster? His mind races, trying to pierce through a thick fog of memory. The last thing he remembers is a deal… a meeting… then nothing. He is blind, stripped of his gear, and trapped. For a man who has always relied on his wits and a quick escape, this is a nightmare realized.",

She opens her eyes to a void, but the physical darkness is less concerning than the one she feels within.\n\nHer senses, the ones beyond sight, extend tentatively. She reaches for the Force to see, but her second sight, once a source of clarity, is now a fractured lens, filled with static and echoes of pain. She feels the smooth, cold curve of an enclosure around her. A slow, aching movement confirms she has been stripped of her staff, her robes, everything. She is a seer without her focus, a witch without her talismans, left with nothing but the tainted power she carries inside her.",

Her heart hammers in her chest, but her limbs are heavy, unresponsive logs of meat. The adrenaline is there, but the body refuses to obey. She opens her eyes and finds only darkness, a suffocating, claustrophobic black that feels like being trapped under rubble.\n\nThe air is cold and stale. She tries to move, to push, but her muscles ache with a profound weakness. She feels the smooth, curved walls of an enclosure, a cage. For a thrill-seeker who lives for speed and open skies, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be trapped, blind, and powerless. A wave of frustrated anger rises in her throat as she realizes she has been stripped of everything, left with nothing but the ghostly sensation of a fall she can\u0027t place.",

A low, dissonant hum inside his own mind, the psychic static of a power source that has catastrophically overloaded. It is an infuriating echo. He opens his eyes to darkness, a simple physical problem that is secondary to the chaos in his own senses. He reaches out with the Force to perceive his surroundings, but his connection, usually a precise dueling blade, is now a fractured, unreliable torrent.\n\nThe weakness in his limbs is an indignity. The cold air is an impurity. He feels the smooth walls of his confinement and realizes with a surge of cold fury that he has been stripped bare. His uniform, his status, his lightsaber—all gone. He is not just a prisoner; he has been reduced to a mere specimen, an outcome his scholarly pride cannot bear.",

The shadows in her soul long chained, long buried rise like smoke in a windless room. The scar on her soul rises to meet it like an old friend. They revel and dance around each other like lost lovers.\n\n“We can fix you…”\n“Free you…”\n“Let you see farther than ever…”\n\nThe temptation is so close. Closer than it’s been in years. The dark speaks with a voice like velvet laced with poison, and her fingers twitch as if they might reach, might surrender. But then  A voice cuts through. Dry, tired and stern. “Varda, old friend. Really? Resorting to such measures already? Compartmentalise. Make a plan. You’re better than this.” Araden, the warrior chiding with the same annoyed fondness as always.\n\nThen another “The first rule of a diplomat,” Lyra’s voice lectures with crisp clarity, “is to never lose your head.”\n\nAnd softer still “Grandma? I thought you said… the darkness, the hate, was bad?” Lyrus. Her light. Her boy.\n\nThe final voice breaks her. So gentle, so intimate. “Varda, my love. Please… you know better. For all we worked for. Now is not when we break.”\n\nA tear slips down her cheek, and with it goes the crushing edge of panic. She chokes back a sob and forces herself to breathe. In, then out. Like it’s the last air she’ll ever taste. No. Not yet. Not ever.",

The surface is impossibly smooth, a single, continuous curve of what feels like reinforced glass or a crystalline polymer, cold to the touch. Where glass meets metal, the join is seamless, fused with a precision that offers no purchase, no hint of a latch or control panel.\n\nShe finds small, shallow depressions spaced at intervals along the inner wall, one near where her wrist might rest, another by an ankle. They are inert, their purpose a mystery. Her careful exploration yields only one truth: this is a cage of perfect, featureless design.\n\nThe low hum of the machinery remains her only companion, indifferent to her struggle and her resolve. The darkness does not yield. Nothing changes.",

What was bothering him wasn’t just the silence, it was the absence of everything else.    He couldn’t feel the presence of the father and his two children.   The three of them were on the run.  Trying to not be discovered by the Empire.   The son, the younger of the two children, was Force sensitive.    He had been hired to take them to… he couldn\u0027t remember.  Immediately he was on alert.   The absence of the memory was concerning as there was no reason for it.  \n\n\n Keeping his calm he focused.   A combination of Mandalorian and Jedi training was bright to bear on the situation.  Cold metal and the thrum of some distant power source reverberated his surrounding area.  A stillness, oppressive in nature, wrapped him in a cocoon.  Similar to the metallic one he did not yet know existed.  \n\n\nLike a punch in the gut his other senses started registering.  No, it was more like they were protesting their current state.   His heart felt like it was just waking up and the air that exited his lungs smelled stale and tasted even worse.  Opening of his eyes held two revelations.  The darkness didn’t subside and his HUD didn’t activate with the movement of his eyes.  *Where’s my helmet?*  He thought as a small but growing tremor of unease ran through his body.",

The thrum of the machinery is not uniform; it\u0027s a layered hum. There\u0027s a low, resonant drone that feels like the power source he first sensed, but beneath it, there is a fainter, higher-pitched whine—the sound of active cryo-circuitry, now in a standby or reanimation cycle.\n\nHis effort yields no escape. The metal remains cold, the darkness absolute, and the pain a constant, nagging reminder of his vulnerability. The silence outside his pod is unbroken.",

They had to be competent. No sloppy welds. No old-world rust. No charming panel held in place by hope and screws. Her captors had the audacity to be efficient.\n\nWith care and focus, she slips a thin thread of control outward, not a surge, but a probe, a tendril of her will uncoiling like a shadow across the polished interior. Her reach is cautious, quiet, tuned to the finer vibrations of structure and energy, like a whisper drawn through glass. It brushes the edges of the capsule.\n\nThe material is dense, layered. composite alloy reinforced with something she cannot name, but can feel. It hums with dormant energy, a low resonance designed to repel not just impact, but disruption. It isn’t simply meant to contain. It\u0027s meant to hold. \n\nShe lets her mind drift further, reaching beyond the interior shell, brushing along the pod’s exterior with quiet precision. Every movement is patient, methodical and desperate without showing it. Her probe glides along the smooth surface, searching for any irregularity: a seam, a fault, a crack in the cage’s immaculate design.\n\nThere has to be something. A hinge. A switch. A flaw. But there is nothing. No mechanical latch. No hidden clasp. No comforting clunk of machinery waiting to yield to a clever hand. The pod is maddeningly seamless, forged with an intent so clinical, so inhumanly perfect, it defies even her most honed instincts.\n\nStill, she presses on. Her will brushes over every inch it can touch, hunting for even the faintest protrusion, any node or raised surface her senses might interpret. Anything her mind can seize upon and twist open with effort or finesse.",

The constant, dissonant hum of his own fractured connection to the Force wars with the low thrum of the machinery, creating a cacophony of internal and external noise.\n\nHe pushes past it, casting his senses out not with finesse, but with raw, focused will. His perception slams against the walls of his prison. The material is, as he might have suspected, anathema to the Force—a dull, leaden weight in the cosmic flow, designed to insulate and contain.\n\nBut the *design*... that is something different. It is not the brutish efficiency of the Empire, nor the chaotic improvisation of the Outer Rim criminals he has hunted. The energy field sealing the pod is woven with a strange, almost biological harmony. The technology is ancient, impossibly so. It speaks of a philosophy of science he has only read about in the most forbidden of Jedi and Sith archives—a time when the Force was not just a power to be wielded, but a fundamental component of engineering.",

There is no reply.\n\nThe sharp sting in his eye from his own finger is a grounding, agonizing flash of reality, confirming the darkness is not a blindfold. The ringing from the impact of his head against the wall joins the pounding in his skull, a cacophony of misery.\n\nThe combination of panic, pain, and the futile physical effort is too much for his compromised system. A wave of acute nausea rolls through him, hot and swift. The acrid taste of bile rises in the back of his throat, and the world—the dark, featureless world inside his head—lurches violently. He collapses back against the bottom of the pod, his frantic energy spent, leaving him weak, dizzy, and trembling in the suffocating blackness.",

The air is sterile, sharp with the scent of ozone.\n\nThey are five strangers, isolated by their individual blindness but now united by proximity. Weakness is a universal language; every limb feels like it\u0027s made of lead, every breath is a conscious effort, and a deep, cellular cold clings to them. For the Force-sensitives, the room is a cacophony of pain and confusion— the fractured echo of their own damaged spirits, and the unsettling hum of the technology that surrounds them.\n\nThe silence between the machinery\u0027s hum is punctuated by the ragged cough of one, the shuddering breath of another. They are adrift in the same boat, blind, weak, and utterly vulnerable. The question, unspoken but hanging heavy in the cold air, is who will be the first to break the silence and discover they are no longer alone.",

No matter how hard he pushed nothing moved and all it did was to make already sore and screaming muscles even more irritable.  \n\nRealizing that using brute force was futile he sank back into his coffin.  *’This isn’t good.’*  He thought to himself.   No sooner had the thought finished a loud *hiss* cut through the silence causing him to startle as the seals released.   Different air rushed in.   He wouldn’t have said it was better as it was cold, recycled and smelled of ozone.  \n\n\nIt was then he felt the others and the sounds of other containers making the same drawn out hissing sounds as his container did.  He drew his Force presence in and laid still for a few seconds as his hand did what it could to cut down the sharp pain of the now intense lighting that stung his eyes.  His limbs felt heavy as he tried to move them.   As he bent his arms and legs he imagined a cracking noise as they moved. When he bent at the waist the pain in his abdomen shot through him causing him his head to spin.  \n\n\nIt didn’t take long for the silence to be broken.  What sounded like a body hitting the floor sounded out.  It was followed by a male voice swearing.  Wes noted the sound of the voice and where it was.   He already had an idea where the humanoid Was.  He wasn’t very focused but he could sense the position of the body off to his left crumpled on the floor.   \n\n\nHe took a deeper breath to talk and the effort was rewarded with a wracking cough as his lungs struggled to cope with the deep breath.   He started to talk but ended up coughing again.  Finally when he was able to take a small bit deeper breath he was able to find his voice.   **”It might be better to wait a moment before moving.”**  He said as loud as he dared not knowing who else was there or listening.  \n\n\nHe didn’t listen to his own advice as he continued to move his limbs attempting to move him to a seated position.",

She senses a space before her, and doesn’t even wait for the tube to finish retracting before she’s scrambling through on her hands and knees. She lets out her breath, a loud, shuddering gasp.\n\nThen she hears it - voices, movement.  Someone curses, a male voice.  Another voice cautions - a deep, low voice, another man, perhaps - that they shouldn’t move. \n\nIyola needs to move.  She crawls forward towards the nearest voice, the first one. Her hands span out, feeling the floor before her for drops or holes.  The metal floor is harsh on her bare knees.\n\n**“Hey, hi, are you OK?

The pod hisses open behind her, and she steps out into the stale, recycled air of a world she does not know. Her feet hit metal, too slick, too cold and a spike of vertigo shoots through her. She clutches her head as sound crashes into her all at once. Raised voices. Footsteps. The sharp shouts of fear. Chaos with the cadence of panic.\n\nShe sighs, rubbing her temple with a grimace. “**By the spirits... we all have the same headache,**” she mutters. “**Yet you’re all still screaming.**” Her voice is hoarse, dry as dust. It doesn’t matter. No one’s listening.\n\nShe reaches out, steadying herself against the nearby wall. Her knees threaten rebellion, and a wave of nausea rises like a tide to drown her. *So that’s how it’s going to be, *she thinks. Worse still, her cane is gone. The absence of its weight throws her balance further, like a limb missing, like a spell half-cast. The world tilts. Her breath comes measured, slow and shallow. She narrows her focus, tucking the pain into a quiet corner of her mind.\n\nAnd then, through the din, she listens. One voice then another and another still. Four, she counts. Distinct, though overlapping. All harried, all reacting. She files their tones, pacing, and rhythms into mental boxes. Names can come later.  For the moment she keeps to herself. waiting to see how the thread unravels.",

She draws the Force to her not in desperation, but with the deliberate grace of an old ritual. Her breath slows.\n\nThe battlefield calm. The silence of a mind balanced on the edge of the blade. That space where instinct and clarity become one. She sinks into it. Feels it take hold. Then, gently, she pushes it outward, Not as a command nor a shove. But a touch a wave of stillness unfurling through the room like warm mist. She threads it through the air, quiet and careful an offer, not an imposition. Like a hand extended, or the hush of an old lullaby. Like a knock at a door asking to be let in. Something that says: You are not alone. You are not in danger. Breathe.\n\nShe lets the wave pulse outwards and raises her voice slightly. \"**Peace companions. In this state we can\u0027t afford to be bubbling around the room like a pack of drunk rancours. We appear to not be in immediate harm. Let us all be calm. No one in this room means to cause pain.**\"",

Vaeros thinks,*She must be strong in the force to overcome this; the calming effect is minuscule, but nice. Wait, is that Jedi speech? Is that why it\u0027s so calming?

They could be helpful in finding her jacket. * She’s not leaving without it.  Another man suggests they go toward the portal, and that seems like as good idea as any.\n\nShe feels the movement in the stale air as the formerly panicking man crawls forward, and she steps to the side, hopefully out of his path. \n\nThen the voice emerged.  Eve.  Some kind of super-powered droid. *What the kriff was the Venture?  And how did she and the rest of them get here? *\n\n**“Eve,**” she asks, **“you said you woke us up.

The Mandalorians demeanor changed as he  sensed no obvious threat for those present and it sounded like they were all waking up from this hibernation and that it had been some time.  Immediately he thought of Marina.  How long has it been?  Almost as quickly as the thought of her entered his mind he tucked it away.  It was something he’d have to look into when their fat wasn’t in the fire.   \n\n\nIt was then he felt it.  As the old woman spoke he felt the subtle waves and her presence in the Force.  Now knowing where she was he looked directly in her direction.   His eyesight was still void of any details but the lower illumination no longer scalded his limited vision.  Instead of what looked like a bright sun he could now make out a fuzz that was more vague than anything else.  The calming presence shifted his mindset as he started looking around.  \n\n\nThe earlier angry male voice spoke again.  He was calmer this time.  His suggestion of moving towards the light seems to make sense.  He nodded but didn’t say anything as he slowly moved towards what seemed like the only light in his hazy vision",

Apparently it would help with the hibernation after effects and it sounded like they were going to need it.  Five unfriendlies were trying to board them.  And from the earlier info Eve had given them the five of them were the only ones on board.

This situation still has many unanswered questions, but he needs to first make it out of the situation alive. Firstly, he needs to get his injection, then his equipment. Based on the potential individuals here, when we get our equipment, he hopes that they don\u0027t understand the implications of the color red. He has enough to process right now. \n\nVaeros continues his unsteady walk towards the compartment holding the vial and grabs it with his hand. He\u0027s hesitant to take the injection, but it\u0027s to survive the intruders in the short term. \n\nVaeros tries to glance around the members near him, **\"Do you individuals have a name to go by? I think it\u0027s relevant to this situation; my name\u0027s Vaeros.\"** As he speaks, he cringes at the thought of forming connections in this situation, but it should ideally keep a minimum, positive relationship; just enough for the group to hopefully dissuade turning on each other if we make it. \n\nWaiting for their response, he stands idle, waiting for the group to move.",

A jolt of absolute, shocking cold shoots up his arm from the injection site, spreading through every vein in a fraction of a second. The deep ache in his muscles crystallizes, then shatters.

The fuzzy, indistinct darkness that has plagued him shatters into a million points of light, which then coalesce with painful clarity. For the first time since waking, he truly *sees*.\n\nHe sees the sterile, metallic cryo-bay they\u0027ve just left, the five open pods recessed into the walls. He sees the others: all of them in various states of undress. The old woman he has taken by the arm, her white hair braided, her expression grim but steady; the angry-sounding man, Vaeros, holding his own injector, his posture taut and suspicious; the younger woman, looking around with a mix of awe and anxiety; and the one who had panicked, still on the floor but now pushing himself up, his eyes wide with a different kind of shock.\n\nThe antechamber before them is short, leading to another heavy, sealed door. Along the walls of this small room are five recessed equipment lockers, each with a small, unlit biometric panel next to it. They are marked with simple, numeric designations: 01, 02, 03, 04, and 05.

The resulting rush was fantastic,* like drop-skiing down Mount Nistari at midnight*.  Plus, now she could actually really see the others here.  Two male humans who looked like they were accustomed to kicking ass (  *Vaeros and Del-Fin?  * Iyola wasn’t sure which was which), one guy with dark shaggy hair, probably the one she’d inadvertently terrified, and an older woman with white braided hair and incredible body art, Varda. **“I love your tattoos,”** she said to her. \n\nShe stepped toward the lockers, ready to reclaim her gear and deal with whatever Eve said was happening on this ship.  *Then she’d call Caz and they’d get out of here. He’d be furious at her for making him worry, but she’d make it up to him. *",

She pulls out the cloak first dark and worn, wrapping her in the comfort of identity. The fabric settles, hiding the tremble in her limbs. Then come the pouches small, precise tools of her trade. She ties them to her belt with deft fingers, each knot anchoring her more firmly in the present.\n\nFinally, she reaches for it. The cane, though it\u0027s more a staff, really. Crafted from dark grey and rich brown wood, its surface is etched with carvings that dance beneath her fingertips: storms in full fury, clouds roiling with motion, lightning split like rivers, and through them, owls, wings spread wide, flying between the chaos. Wisdom threading the storm.\n\nEvenly spaced along the staff are three rings of polished beskar, A metal with a dull gleam in the light. Each one is etched with the same intricate runes and sigils that mark her own skin. a harmony of metal, wood, and self.\n\nShe draws it free with both hands, holding it reverently, as if greeting an old friend. Relief flickers across her features she takes a slow breath. She leans on it, finally having her anchor once again. Then, with quiet deliberation, she taps the cane against the floor. Once. Twice. Thrice. Each tap releases a hum, low and resonant, like a tuning fork struck by time itself. The beskar rings sing in harmony, a layered chord of storm and steel.\n\nShe turns to Iyola. a small twinge at the side of her mouth, the crows feet deepen as she regards her. \"**Ahh, why thank you. They were a right of passage. It\u0027s been so long now I sometimes forget they\u0027re there**\" She lets out a small chuckle.",

It feels like coming home.\n\nBut as they take inventory, a subtle and unsettling wrongness becomes apparent. Any datachips or datapads they owned are present, but their memory has been wiped clean, formatted to a factory default. Any holocrons, those precious repositories of unique knowledge, are simply gone.\n\nAnd their credits, the universal currency of the galaxy, have been replaced. In their place non-descript synth-leather pouch. Inside, a small collection of cut gemstones—lustrous sapphires, fiery opals, deep green emeralds—clinks softly together. They are clearly valuable, but their origin and purpose are a complete mystery.

He decides to follow along, and he looks for his locker. \n\nReaching his respective locker, it glows, clicking open as the locks disengage. He first dresses in his black vacuum suit, with Imperial insignia on both upper arms, then wears a black robe and pants over it. Once his clothes are on, he fastens his cortosis gauntlets on his forearms, a wrist-mounted commlink,  a utility belt around his waist, and attaches an inquisitor\u0027s mask to it. Once it\u0027s in place, he triggers the vacuum seal on his suit and turns on his commlink, with a chirp indicating its operation.\n\nReaching into the locker again, he realizes something is critically missing: his holocron, his prized possession granted to him during the Clone Wars under Dooku\u0027s group of Dark Acolytes. His data pad and credit chips work, but they are missing his notes, maps, and banking information. In place of it is a pouch of luxury jewels.

With a cursory glance he looked inside.   It all appeared to be there.  His Beskar\u0027gam and blaster were prominent as well as his other gear.   \n\n\nTaking a breath he reached for the black body suit he wore beneath the armor.  It pulled on easily which only spurred him on faster.   Boots went on next followed by his leg armor.  Each piece was placed and attached with a practiced efficiency that only came from years of repetition.   As he let the chest and back plates settle onto his shoulders it became obvious as to what he was.   Mandalorian.  A familiar metallic sound from something Varda tapped against the deck plating caught his attention.  It was the sound of Beskar.   He spotted her cane and the three pieces of Beskar that adorned it.   He raised an eyebrow wondering but knowing that this wasn’t the time.  \n\n\nBeyond her he saw Vaeros attach a lightsaber hilt and an inquisitor mask to his utility belt.  He stood up quickly looking at the man.  Taking note of his appearance.   He took a deep breath as he fought to keep control of his emotions and his Force presence in close as to not give himself away to the enemy.   The one he’d been on the run from for over a decade.  His eyes spoke what words didn’t.   And he knew it would have to wait.   *’The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  For now.’*  He thought as he reached for his bucket and pulled it on over his head.   His blaster and utility belt were next. As he looked them both over before adding the rest of his armor.  He looked over his arm vambraces and nodded satisfied that all was in order.  That his lightsaber was still hidden within the right vambrace.    \n\n\nHe stood almost two meters tall now.   His hand resting on the grip of his blaster pistol.   The HUD in his helmet giving him information on his surroundings.",

It must have meaning to you….  Did you make it?”** She peeked at the runes on it to see if she recognized any of them.\n\nFinding her own locker, Iyola gratefully grabbed her gear, pulling on her pants, boots, belt, and harness, strapping on her ascension gun, and, of course, her beloved turquoise-green synthleather jacket. \n\nA younger blond man was dressing himself in a very impressive dark-hued ensemble - black cape, metal bracers, with some kind of gear-like symbol that Iyola didn’t recognize immediately. *It would likely come to her soon enough. *\n\nHe introduced himself as Vaeros. Iyola smiled back with one of her sunniest smiles.  He was pretty cute. She couldn’t help but notice the lightsaber on his belt.  **“Hi Vaeros, it’s good to meet you**,” Iyola said  **“Glad to have a Jedi with us in this kind of situation. And, I’m sure, other situations too.” **\n\nThe tall, muscular man - this one must be Del-Fin, then - was dressing himself with great care in metal armor.  Looked like the traditional costumes she’d seen  in Keldabe, on the outer rim planet of Mandalore.  It was interesting to see the complete kit in action.  \n \nThe scruffy, dark-haired man looked a lot happier after the drug injection.  He was wearing absurd red goggles. *He looked like he’d be a lot of fun, or trouble, or both.  * Dryzan - that was his name - asked them all if they were ready to kark things up.  Iyola laughed a bit, which felt good.** “I mean, not on purpose, but maybe” she replied.**",

Vaeros, now clad in the severe black of his old life, carries an air of cold analysis, while Iyola\u0027s natural curiosity and bright energy begin to reassert themselves.\n\nVarda stands a little apart, the ancient wood of her staff a grounding presence in her hands. The runes are unfamiliar to Iyola\u0027s eyes, their patterns ancient and alien, unlike any script she\u0027s seen in Republic or even Outer Rim archives. They seem less like writing and more like a map of natural forces—the flow of wind, the crack of lightning, the spiral of a galaxy.\n\nAs the last piece of armor is buckled and the last weapon holstered, the sterile silence is broken by a chime. On the wall behind them, a large holographic display flickers to life, drawing their attention.",

The bright blue synthweave jacket, cut bold and modern, practically glowing under the sterile light. The one clad in dark, practical layers, a lightsaber resting at his hip and lastly, the figure in the broad, heavy trench coat with a humorous quirk to lips. She studies each of them with a silent, appraising eye. \n\nHer thoughts drift like smoke, but she anchors them with a smile as Iyola admires her staff. “**Aye, I did,**” Varda replies, pride softening her features. “**It took many weeks of carving, of long, patient work. But I’ve no regrets. The storm teaches patience, and in the end, I’m content with what it’s become.”**” Her fingers brush the storm-carved wood as she speaks, and then, without hesitation, her eyes flit to Iyola’s attire. “**That jacket of yours is finely cut, dear. The colour suits you well, it catches the light like water across stone. Makes your complexion glow**”\n\nShe turns as Vaeros speaks, Varda gives a small nod of agreement at the suggestion of comlinks. She moves with quiet steps walking forward and offering each of them her personal signal in turn. Then, with a smooth motion, she places her own in the crook of her ear. The small device hums faintly as it activates. \n\nBusiness handled, her gaze drifts toward the projection. the image of the intruders. Her expression shifts. A deep line creases her brow. Her lips press thin. She wonders *Why this ship? if from what I\u0027ve seen we\u0027re a handful of nobodies locked in stasis. What reason do they have to board?*",

That feeling you get when you return to a familiar place, only to find the walls repainted and the floorboards slightly out of place. The bones of it remain, but the soul has shifted.... She sees it then, not with her eyes, but with the deep sense that has guided her longer than either of them have likely lived.\n\n*How strange...There’s something in the way they hold themselves. Not the set of shoulders or the stance of their feet, but in the Force. Their presences are tight, drawn inwards like silk thread pulled taut. Woven too fine like they\u0027re shielded or...or they’re hiding?* she realises.\n\nShe remembers the younger sisters, long ago those first initiates who trembled through their meditations, uncertain and raw. When fear gripped them, they would coil inward, stifle their light, as if to keep the galaxy from hearing them breathe. *Perhaps,* she wonders. *These two never had the guided hand of a stable teacher. Or worse, perhaps they were taught by someone who believed fear was strength, or silence was safety.*",

We did not clutch it to our chests like secrets waiting to be stolen.*\n\nAs the others begin to prepare, checking weapons, adjusting gear, sharpening focus. She reaches outward, with a series of soft, playful tendrils. Thin wisps of her presence spun like threads of silk into the current of the Force. She touches Vaeros first. Just a brush. Like tapping the surface of still water with the edge of her thought. *Why so taught?* Then Del-fin, with a gentler nudge. A coaxing flicker. *Are you there?*\n\nShe prods here, tugs there, spins her presence around them like an eager puppy. It’s the same game she used to play with the younger sisters in the halls of Ichor. teasing, almost, but always with purpose. *Come on, her presence whispers, light and wry. Just a little spark. Let me see how you shine.* It\u0027s been many years since she encountered another force user. But to see them so confined makes her rage on the inside. It makes her want to see them truly be free",

His speech reminds her of the administrators and professors in her family, and his bow is formal.  She wonders where he’s from.  *Maybe Chandrilla?*  His suggestion to share the comlink signals is a good one.\n\nIyola pulls out her comlink from one of her multiple pockets. Instinctively, she flips to Caz’s code - maybe there’s time to send him a quick all-clear-  *it’s blank*.  She stares at the com for a click, then cycles through the other codes.  *Mom, Dad - sisters, friends, they’re all gone. * She draws a quick, sharp breath, and her hand shakes a bit.\n\nShe swallows hard.  She has contingency plans.  She’ll deal with this later. She shares her comlink information with the others, and then *she’s got to do something*.\n\n**“Hey, Eve, can you download the schematic to my datapad and mark the fastest route?” ** She turns to the others.  **“We can get to the inner door before they enter if we’re fast enough, but we’ve got to go now.” **",

It then fades into another haze, a blonde Jedi kneeling at an older, bearded man clad in a brown cape. The Jedi proudly displays his Lightsaber, now red, but it shifts again; The defeated Jedi, now in black, kneeling in defeat against a black-suited man. The man is the purest form of darkness imaginable. With the thought of him escaping from Vaeros, he instinctively shuts himself off from the unknown intruder. \n\nVaeros shutters, instinctively force pulling his lightsaber to his right hand. He glances around until he notices that Iyola is organizing the team, **\"Sure, Iyola, I\u0027ll be right behind you.\"**",

The path looked pretty straightforward and with Eve locking all other doors it should be even easier.  **”Lets not wait.”** He stopped talking as soon as Vaeros’s lightsaber found its way to his hand.

The air here is colder, the silence deeper. It is a ghost ship, a place of long-dormant machinery and forgotten purpose.\n\nAs they step forward, the section of the corridor immediately ahead of them flickers to life. Dim, white emergency lights embedded in the floor and ceiling cast long, distorted shadows, giving the hallway an eerie, spectral glow. The metal walls seem to absorb the light, making the space feel both illuminated and deeply shadowed at the same time.\n\nThey press on, a strange collection of figures moving through the silent ship—a hulking Mandalorian, a robed Inquisitor, a wiry scoundrel, a brightly-clad scout, and an old woman leaning on an ancient staff. As they pass the midway point of the lit section, the lights behind them extinguish, plunging the path they\u0027ve just walked back into absolute darkness. Simultaneously, the next section of the corridor ahead illuminates, beckoning them forward.\n\nHeavy bulkhead doors block their path at intervals. As they approach, each door slides open with a whisper of hydraulics, revealing another identical, dimly lit section of corridor, only to hiss shut again once the last person has passed through, leaving them with the unsettling feeling of being drawn deeper into the ship\u0027s heart, with no easy way back. The only sound is the soft scuff of their boots on the deck plating and their own measured breathing.",

It\u0027s a ship meant for life, but now lays hauntingly void of it.\n\nShe pauses once. Then again. A hand placed delicately on a bulkhead where her breathing slow, steady, as if catching herself. To the untrained eye, she looks exactly as she intends: an older woman, weathered by years, taking a moment to gather her strength. But to those with sharper senses, those who know what to watch for, those trained in this exact art know there’s something else beneath it. This image of an older woman is exactly that, an image. A subtle performance. A shield. She leans into the illusion with the precision of someone who has used it before. *Let them underestimate me now,* she thinks, *and regret it later if they must.*\n\nEach time someone glances her way, she offers a warm, patient smile, gentle, grandmotherly. The image is convincing. Comforting, even. But as the ship’s lights flicker that crimson red. The warmth fades from her expression. Her pace quickens, cane tapping more sharply against the floor. Her posture straightens. The mask does not drop, not entirely, but the edge behind it shows.",

Since his data pad no longer has a copy of his original texts, he has to retype what he can by memory before he eventually forgets bits and pieces. A snippet of text catches his eye, as he reads what he wrote, *Regardless, Varda is strange; why does an elderly woman wish to fight these intruders? She looks frail, winded, but still manages to keep up with the group. Strange.* As he walks, he thinks over the texts about this group and their respective quirks. What makes them tick? \n\nAs he continues to jot things down, he remains torn between his conditioning and personal desires to learn and explore this new opportunity. Should he try a different path?

As they set off for the inner door, the older woman  seemed calm and unconcerned,  as if they were all out for a Zhellday  stroll.  Her eyes, a purple color, were bright and kind, and she smiled warmly at Iyola when she looks her way.  Iyola smiles back.  Despite her age, Varda was keeping up with the group just fine, and didn’t appear to need any assistance at the moment. \n\nVaeros has put on a strange mask, severe, angled, and elegant.

A wave of pressure washes over all of them, a sudden, gut-wrenching vertigo that makes the floor seem to tilt.

Something infinitely worse:\n\n|| A psychic shriek of pure, unadulterated agony slams into their minds. \nIt is not a thought, but a raw, sensory onslaught—a spike of ice-cold terror driven through their skulls. The impression is a chaotic, layered torrent of torment, flashing by in an instant: There is the physical violation—the feeling of being pinned down, limbs held fast by overwhelming, brutal strength. The sharp, lingering spasm from the directed energy of a stun collar, followed by the dull, sickening thud of a physical blow. \n\nWoven through it is an agonizing low where every nerve ending is scraped raw and screaming for a poison it has been taught to need. Then the jarring rush of a new injection, a thick, syrupy numbness that smothers the sharp edges of pain, replacing it with a disorienting, hollow float. This, too, is a violation—the feeling of one\u0027s own will being chemically drowned, only to be ripped away again, leaving the agony of withdrawal even sharper than before. \n\nThey can feel the greasy, leering satisfaction of a predator, the callous amusement of onlookers, and the bitter, metallic tang of blood and fear in the air. It is the psychic echo of a will being systematically, cruelly, and repeatedly broken through every means available. \nBut through the storm of pain, drugs, and violation, a single, focused point of light remains—a core of incandescent, defiant rage. It is a desperate, silent plea for **help**, a final, focused beacon from someone who refuses to be completely extinguished. ||\n\nThe wave lasts only a second, but it feels like an eternity. Then, it is gone, leaving behind a ringing silence and the phantom ache of another\u0027s torment.\n\nThe source is undeniable: it is coming from the other side of that airlock.",

He was still shaken from the onslaught of emotions as he tried to stand straight as he took another step.  ***”We\u0027re coming!”*** He projected this thought and feelings out into the Force no longer caring about his company.   \n\n\n**”Someone needs our help, Dryzan.”**  He said with a raspy voice as he drew his blaster taking uneven steps towards the airlock.",

One trembling hand clamps against her temple, the other clawing for balance that will not come. Her cane goes skittering across the floor. \n\nWhen she looks up, her eyes are glassy with tears welling, uncontrolled. She is drowning. Drowning in the sudden, crushing tide of emotion, that itself opens a dam inside her and lets every buried scream flood to the surface. Her legs feel distant. Disconnected. Useless beneath her. She clenches her eyes shut. Desperately trying to escape, trying to shut it out, the pain, the pressure, the overwhelming presence. But even that brings no peace. She teeters between two agonies: The dominating will of something vast and merciless crashing into her… And the terror of cutting herself off. Of silencing one of her most vital senses, of becoming blind in the dark. She shudders, caught between the instinct to survive and the fear that to protect herself. \n\nShe falls deeper into herself. The gnawing void of helplessness claws at her spirit, and around it coils a sick, gleeful amusement. Not hers. Never hers. A shadow whispering that she is small, broken, lost. She trembles. But then...Light.\n\nIt bursts through her like a supernova. She doesn’t know its source. She doesn’t care. She latches onto it like a drowning woman to driftwood, gasping against the current. She seizes the moment. With tears still staining her cheeks, with her limbs still trembling and her body rebelling, she jabs a hand toward the floor. Her cane, her staff, flies to her grip, called with a snap of authority. The carved wood slaps against her palm like a memory returned.",

It is the fury of storms, of mountains groaning under strain, of wildfire sparked by injustice. A righteous resentment at the taking of will. Her presence in the Force changes. Where once it flowed playful and curious like a soft breeze drifting through the corridors, it now begins to gather, building with a rising pressure. A wind before the storm.\n\nwith the proclamation from Mandalorian, She marches forward. Unsteady and rickety but all together moving forward.",

His hand was still upon the wall for support.  Memories of the Purge bounced around in his head.  The sudden loss of life that followed Order 66 was still a distant scar of a memory.  One that he would never be rid of.  While this was different it was no less powerful to him.  The person was still alive but the despair and pain was overwhelming.  Whoever it was it felt that they had been subjected to torture for some time.\n\n\nWords from Dryzan cause him to focus on the here and now.  He pushed off the wall with his hand finding his feet mostly steady.  He looked towards the others.  Varda had made it to her feet as the others were doing so as well.   The old woman surprised him.  She was following and he could feel the shift in her presence.  In it he felt a promise of retribution for what had just happened.  He gave her an approving nod as he looked at Dryzen.  The cold unnerving visage of his helmet was the only emotion that could be seen.  He held the man\u0027s gaze for a second before speaking.  **”I am no Jedi.”**  His voice was heard over the comms.  His voice, like his armor, sounded hard after the emotional onslaught that they had all just suffered. \n\n\n**”Iyola, Vaeros?”**  He said as he saw them recovering from what they had just experienced.  **”You ready.”**  He asked, needing to be sure they were good as a group to face off against these pirates and whatever else was aboard.",

This is the second guy she’s freaked out today.  *She must be much more intimidating than she had realized.*   He takes off the strange mask, and smiles at her, or tries to, like it’s something he doesn’t do a lot.  *It’s a good attempt,anyway.*  \n\n**“Oh, I see. That’s smart. I was worried that you were writing up some kind of Council report on us,”** she  said.  When he asked in his formal manner if she needed anything, she shrugged. ** “Just to repel these invaders, explore the Venture, then ping my boyfriend and get back to my ship,”** she explained. \n\nAny further conversation was cut off as they rounded the corner. \n\n   A wave of awful sensation overcame her -  she’s helpless, agonized, nauseated. Her limbs feel like they’ve turned to ice.  A strange ringing sound fills her ears - it sounds like screaming.  Iyola lurches towards the nearest wall to steady herself, slips, sits down hard.  She feels horrible.\n\nThe sensation recedes.   Her cheeks are covered in cold tears and snot. \n\nShe looks around, rising to her feet, and sees that others had experienced something similar.  She hears Dryzan, the man with the red goggles, curse and mutter, and sees him draw his blaster.  Iyola uses the edge of Vaeros’s cape to wipe her face off.  It doesn’t work that well - the fabric is coated with something impermeable and unpleasantly scratchy.   \n\n Del-Fin asks in his harsh martial voice if they’re all ready for the fight.  Iyola nods and draws her gun. It’s oversized in order to accommodate its ascension function, but it also happens to pack a real punch. Since she’s going ranged first, she situates herself near Dryzan, to help cover him and Varda. \n\n**“Mandalorians don’t even like Jedi,”** she whispers to Dryzan.",

His hands, raw and scraped, tremble uncontrollably as they work with a frantic energy, pulling wires and bypassing circuits on the inner airlock door\u0027s control panel. It\u0027s a tremor that speaks not just of fear, but of exhaustion and withdrawal.\n\nAround his neck is a thick, metallic collar, a single red light blinking on its surface like a malevolent eye.\n\nThe purpose of the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s remote is now brutally clear. It\u0027s not a remote detonator. It\u0027s a leash.\n\nSparks intermittently fly from the damaged panel, casting fleeting, harsh light on the technician\u0027s face.

The door technician is most likely a slave, so we should set our goal towards removing the intruders and getting information from the man.\"**\n\nAs he speaks, he pulls the lightsaber into his right hand, keeping it unignited.",

He reached out to the man with the Force.  He sensed the man and swirling emotions that plagued the human.  What he didn’t sense was his active presence in the Force.  He wasn\u0027t the one that reached out to them.  \n\n\n**”He’s not the one that reached out.   There’s another on board their ship somewhere.”**  \n\n\nHe looked over at Vaeros who offered a suggestion.   **”I have no love for slavers.  Odds are if Eve hadn\u0027t woken us up they would have found us and they would be our captors.   If we don’t stop them that will also be the case.”** Wes didn’t trust the Inquisitor but for the moment he knew that the man didn’t want to end up a slave.  **”On their ship we will not have the advantage of knowing the surroundings.   At least here we are on equal footing and we have Eve.  There is still the one who reached out.   They are still on the slaver ship.”**",

With a sharp, powerful hiss, air begins to equalize between the two ships, the sound momentarily drowning out all other noise in the corridor.

The elderly woman Varda wisely decided to remain out of close range.\n\nJust then, the door integrity began to fail. Iyola decided she was still too close; she didn’t want to interfere with the hand-to-hand combatants.  She noticed a panel just behind her that would make solid cover.  It was too loud to speak. She ducked behind it, gesturing for Varda to get behind her, as she lined up her sight lines towards the portal.\n\n*Am I supposed to kill these beings?  *The thought sat uneasily on her.

The Mandalorians\u0027 hand twitched involuntarily at the inquisitor’s movement.  When Vaeros mentioned that the two of them would handle things up front while the others provided cover fire he took a deep breath.   That same breath was held in surprise when he heard the *snap-hiss* of the lightsaber and watched as the red blade sprang forth.   It was solidified then, he was going to have to fight alongside the agent of the Emperor.  Ones who had been sworn to hunt down those like him.  Yet something was different about Vaeros.    He had always been able to stay one step ahead of the Empire and its minions thus making this his first interaction with an inquisitor.   Under the circumstances he wished it was not the last meeting for either of them once this was over.  \n\n\nHis heavy boots sounded out across the deck plating as he walked up towards Vaeros and stood to his left side and looked at the others.    **”Vaeros is right, we will take the lead.  The rest of you cover us.   Varda however you can help us with your ability will be of great value.”**  Wes didn’t outright say he had a feeling she could do.   In the present times that was up to her to reveal.   His head swiveled back to Vaeros as he holstered his blaster.   He held the look as he released his grip on it while simultaneously activating the secret compartment on the inside of his right vambrace.  With his left he removed a cylindrical object that would look similar to the one the dark one held who stood next to him.  As the vambrace closed he switched the weapon to his right hand.",

With a guttural snarl, Vex lunges forward, his vibro-ax swinging in a vicious, overhead arc aimed to cleave the Inquisitor in two.\n\nVaeros stands his ground, calm and precise. His crimson blade flashes up, meeting the descending ax not with brute force, but with the elegant, economical motion of Makashi. The crackle of energy against cortosis-weave metal fills the corridor. He deflects the blow, but the sheer momentum behind it drives him back a step, a sharp pain lancing through his side. Before Vex can recover, Vaeros twists his wrist, turning the parry into a fluid riposte. The tip of his lightsaber scores a deep, smoking gash across the Twi\u0027leks\u0027s shoulder, and a hiss of surprise and pain escapes the slaver\u0027s lips.\n\nBefore the enforcer can fully register the counter-attack, Wes closes the distance. The Mandalorian\u0027s green blade moves in a tight, efficient arc, slicing across Vex\u0027s exposed flank. Staggered between the two lightsaber-wielding figures, the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s eyes widen.\n\nFrom the relative safety of her cover, Iyola lines up a perfect shot. A brilliant blue bolt of energy erupts from her blaster, striking the enforcer square in the chest. He seizes up, his body convulsing as the stun charge courses through his system, his predatory grin replaced with a grimace of neurological shock.\n\nPressing the advantage, Vaeros steps forward again. His crimson blade dances with deadly precision, a swift thrust that bites deep into the Twi\u0027lek’s other shoulder. The enforcer roars, a sound of pure fury and agony.",

It is the cold, dispassionate sound of a predator stating the obvious terms of engagement. The threat isn\u0027t angry; it\u0027s factual, and that makes it all the more chilling.\n\nThe words land like ice water on the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s panicked mind. His eyes dart from the unblinking red lenses of Vaeros\u0027s mask to the steady green blade of the Mandalorian, then down at the trembling technician in his grasp. The logic is brutal and undeniable. These weren\u0027t soft-hearted heroes; they were killers. Why *would* they care about this one piece of meat? His shield was worthless.\n\nFor a split second, the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s resolve crumbles. The offer of life, any life, is a hook he can\u0027t ignore.\n\nWith a final, desperate snarl, he shoves the hostage violently forward. The technician stumbles, crying out as he trips and falls sprawling onto the deck plating at Wes\u0027s and Vaeros\u0027s feet.\n\nThe distraction is all the Twi\u0027lek needs. He doesn\u0027t wait for a reply. He turns and bolts, disappearing into the dark corridor of the ship from which he came. The sound of his frantic, retreating footsteps echoes back into the antechamber.\n\nThe immediate standoff is over. The hostage is free, but the enemy is escaping.",

It was deathly quiet after the chaos of the first action of battle.   The only two sounds in the quiet was the low hum of the two lightsabers casting red and green shadows.   He then saw the will to fight leave the slavers eyes as the tech was pushed forward violently a split second before he tore off back into his ship.   \n\n\nQuickly Wes moved to the fallen tech who was now sprawled out on the deck plating.   Kneeling down he kept his blade to the side as he rolled the tech over.  Wes could tell that he wasn’t the one who had reached out before.    **”Hey.  Be calm.  Listen to me.   Someone on that ship reached out with the Force.   It wasn’t you.  Who was it that reached out?  Where are they?  Tell us and we can free you and whoever else they are holding.”**",

His senses reached out towards the aft of the slaver ship searching for the one that was mentioned.  There was a sense of urgency in his search.   They were about to enter an unfriendly ship and their time frame was unknown.   \n\n\nHe could sense the fear of the Twi’lek as he raced towards the front of the ship.  The cockpit perhaps.  Near the aft of the ship he felt her, Nadia.  The one who unleashed the psychic scream was now just a flicker of flame, a candle in the breeze.  That small flicker felt as if it could be sniffed out at any moment.   Along that area he senses the tech that had just left them in fear.  He was heading her way.   He was about to turn when something else stood out.   Another presence, one that was quiet as if it wanted to remain hidden.  The presence was along the path that the Twi’lek was taking.   \n\n\nHe turned towards the group.   **”This Nadia who he spoke of is in the aft cargo hold.  I can sense her there.”**  He said matter of factly as he raised his left hand in that direction.  **”He’s racing there right now.   The slaver is going towards the fore of the ship.  There’s someone else along his path.   They are trying to remain hidden.”**",

And somehow - was it Varda, perhaps? - the gigantic gunner had collapsed in a pile of flesh and flak armor.  *Were they all Jedi?  Dryzan too? Or could you use a lightsaber without being a Jedi?*  She’d only seen one lightsaber lit prior to day, and that hadn’t been in combat; it was when Lagan finally succumbed to her pleading and let her ignite and hold his weapon.\n\nShe remembered how weightless it had felt in her hand, and its beautiful icy blue color; he’d stopped her before she could twirl it around.  Now that she’d seen them used, she could understand why, but she’d been disappointed, and still was.  *Maybe that meant she could get a lightsaber for herself. It would be super-useful for ship repairs too. *\n\nTo her surprise, the technician had fled back into the ship. *They were scarier than whatever was on their vessel.* The thought was heartening.\n\nHer brow furrowed at Vaeros’s suggestion.  **“Dispose of, you mean restrain him?  I have some binds that might work.”**  He was a Jedi, if a weird one; certainly he couldn’t mean what she thought he had said. *Maybe Standard wasn’t his first language.* \n\nDel-Fin stated his intention to free Nadia, who was a Force user the rest of them could sense.  That sounded like a good plan, and fortunately lightsabers were also an excellent source of illumination.  The green and red blades cast clashing, bright beams.\n\nIyola turned to Varda as they set off. **“Varda, are you a Jedi too?”**",

The only known Mandalorian Jedi was ages ago, and had a legendary blade. Even then, upon his passing, Mandalorians stole his weapon to use as a self-insert as ruler. The way Wes fights isn\u0027t a traditional Jedi stance either; perhaps his master is a Bokken Jedi?*\n\nRegardless, Vaeros nods at the disarmament of the fallen man, **\"That works as well; if you use those binds, Iyola, it would be helpful; the sooner we move forward and access their ship, the sooner we can leave. These pirates, or whatever they are, seem to be here to enslave us, kill us, or worse. Nonetheless, we all seem to have unique properties in some way, and that\u0027s all the more reason we should avoid capture, if we make some assumptions based on the individual reaching out in the force.\"**\n\nVaeros glances over at Wes, then back at the group, **\"It seems that he already made up his mind.

For a tense second, everyone freezes, but the man\u0027s head just lolls to the side, and he sinks back into stillness.\n\nWith the immediate threat secured, Wes takes a decisive lead down the dark corridor of the ship, his green blade carving a path through the gloom. The choice is made for them. The rhythmic hiss of the emergency lights activating and deactivating ahead of him creates a strobing, urgent effect, pulling them deeper into the hostile ship. The air here is different—thicker, smelling of unidentifiable spilled fluids, stale nutrient paste, and the faint, coppery tang of fear.\n\nThe path forward splits. To the right, a narrower corridor likely leads towards the crew quarters and cockpit, the direction the terrified Twi\u0027lek fled. To the left, a wider, more industrial passage smelling of ozone and charged machinery leads towards the aft cargo bay, the direction the technician ran and where Wes\u0027s senses tell him the captive, Nadia, awaits.\n\nThe path to the aft cargo hold is short, but the sense of dread grows with every step. The emergency lights flicker more erratically here, casting the grimy walls in a chaotic dance of light and shadow. Ahead, the corridor opens into the dark expanse of the main cargo hold.",

Between the flickering lights and the green glow of his lightsaber there was an eerie feeling.  Several smells also filtered down from the aft leading corridor.   One’s he’d rather not know the origins from.  Overwhelmingly there was the sense of fear.  One that if it couldn’t be sensed in the Force the all knowing scent of it lingered heavily.  \n\n\n**”Split up or stay together?”**  He waited a moment for them to consider their action but it wasn’t more than a couple glances towards both paths.   **”There is also the other presence that’s trying to remain hidden heading up front.”**\n\n\nNot wanting to wait any longer he indicated the path aft.  He led the way with his lightsaber held defensively letting the blade effectively light the way.   The lighting was even more erratic.   It was as if the crew purposefully neglected this area of the ship.  The smells of captivity became stronger as did the smell of the fear.  He reached out once again with the force to this ‘Nadia’ that was being held.  ***’We are coming.’***  He sent his thoughts outward along with a calm presence through the force to the woman.   Those with him who could sense it could feel his calm presence and determination as he walked.  It combined with his appearance was something that the galaxy hadn’t seen in untold years.   A Force sensitive Mandalorian wielding a Jedi’s weapon.  \n\nHis eyes took in the corridor and his senses remained open as he walked into the opening of the dark cargo bay.",

It is a clean, orderly note in a symphony of static and fear. It feels ancient, structured, and humming with a cold, intellectual purity that is profoundly out of place on this grimy slaver vessel. It is the psychic equivalent of discovering a perfectly preserved, unopened manuscript lying in a filthy gutter.\n\nIt is the scent of *knowledge*, and to Vaeros, it is a lure far more potent than any plea for help or tactical advantage.

It was weak but he could sense her holding on to his presence in an effort to stay above water.  \n\n\nThe feeling only pulled him farther into the hold where the lighting was dim and flickering.

The Mandalorian stopped and knelt next to the tech.  The man’s presence in the Force was no more.   His neck was burnt.   He wasn’t sure I felt it was from a remote activation or from the overload of the now smoking panel.  From the looks of it the man gave his life to free his fellow captive.  Reaching out with his free hand he closed the man\u0027s eyes and stood.   Looking at the door he could sense the presence on the other side.  \n\n\nHe reached out again this time her presence was stronger or maybe she was more aware now that help was close.  Now though, he could sense something oddly familiar.   Yet he couldn’t place the feeling or why it felt familiar to him.

The room is small, barely more than a storage locker. A single, hard bunk is bolted to the wall, a stained nutrient dispenser in the corner. The air is thick with the scent of fear, antiseptic, and something else—a cloying, chemical sweetness.\n\nOn the bunk, a small figure is curled into a tight fetal position, facing the wall. It’s a young woman, swallowed by a dirty  tunic barely covering her to her knees. Her light brown hair is matted with sweat. She trembles, not from cold, but from a constant, low-grade tremor of trauma and withdrawal. She is muttering to herself in a strange, guttural language.\n\nAs Wes steps into the room, the woman flinches violently at the new sound, pressing herself tighter against the cold metal wall. Her head whips around. Her eyes are wide, pupils dilated, unfocused. They dart from the green glow of Wes’s lightsaber to the looming shadow of Varda in the doorway, filled not with hope, but with the raw, instinctual terror of a cornered animal that has forgotten what it means not to be harmed. She makes no move to stand, no cry for help—only a low, guttural whimper escapes her lips as she braces for the next blow.",

It doesn\u0027t heal, but it soothes the rawest edges of her terror.\n\nHer trembling subsides slightly. Her breathing, while still shallow, loses its panicked, hitching quality. In the dim, flickering light from the corridor, her eyes adjust. The silhouette is no longer just a monster; it resolves into the unmistakable shape of a Mandalorian helmet, the hard lines of beskar pauldrons. A single word, a broken whisper, escapes her lips, hoarse from disuse and fear.\n\n**\"Mando\u0027ade...\"**\n\nIt is not a plea, but a statement of recognition. A flicker of something other than terror in her wide, haunted eyes. Then, her gaze darts away from him, fixing on a heavy durasteel spacer\u0027s chest in the far corner of the room. It is a clear, desperate, unspoken request.\n\nThe chest is well-used, its edges dented and scuffed from rough handling. Subtly etched into the lid, almost lost among the scratches, is the snarling profile of a red wolf—the Rekr, the sigil of Clan Skirata. Tucked just beneath the main latch, a thin pressure plate sits slightly askew, clearly wired to the chest\u0027s power cell. It is an obvious, if cleverly placed, trap.",

The terror she felt was still present but it felt as if it may have dropped ever so slightly.   When her eyes adjusted he saw them widen in surprise.  He saw the recognition in them as she swallowed in an attempt to speak.  The single word she uttered sent a shiver down his back.   \n\n\n*’Mando’ade.’*\n\n\nHe almost rocked back onto his heels at hearing the language he hadn\u0027t heard or used in a decade since he self exiled after the fall of the Republic and the Jedi.  He was brought out of his thoughts as he watched her turn her head to the side.  Answering her unspoken question he followed her gaze to the far corner.  Once again in the span of a few seconds he was surprised as his eyes took in the symbol of a red wolf that he recognized immediately.  Lessons from when he was a child. Sigils of other Clans flashed in his mind.  **”Clan Skirita.”** He said softly more to himself than anyone else yet it was loud enough for Varda to hear.  His gaze quickly looked back at the woman.  Nadia. Mandalorian.\n\n\n**”Elek, Ner Vod.”**  He said softly, letting his voice and his presence continue in its attempt to calm her.  Assuring her that she was now safe.  Again his anger towards the slavers ticked up another notch.  \n\n\n**”We’re going to get you out of here.  Nadia.”**  He made sure he had her attention before continuing.  **”Are there any others besides your friend?”**\n\n\nHe keyed the comm channel immediately.  **”Anyone good with traps?  I’m going to need some help here.”**   \n\n\nHe looked to his right where Varda stood.  **”Can you help me with her?  She’s Mandalorian.”**  His voice was urgent. It had been ten years since he’d seen another Mandalorian and he wasn’t about to leave her or her storage chest behind.\n\n\n\n\nTranslation: \nElek, Ner Vod - Yes Brother/Sister",

If they found other victims with shock collars, it might help her disable them, and she wanted to see what exactly had caused the fatal overload, since she wasn’t eager to replicate whatever had killed Derek.\n\nJust then she heard Del-Fin call out over the comm for someone who was good with traps.  She glanced at Dryzan and Vaeros,  but neither immediately volunteered themselves.    *It’s on me.  *\n\nIyola strode through the door.  **“So what have we - oh.” ** She looked with surprise and sympathy at the forlorn prisoner, then follows Del-Fin’s gaze to the durasteel locker.\n\n**“Oh, hey, is that Mandalorian?”  **The trap is obvious, but she has to wonder if there’s something else going on here too with the machinery.  *How smart are these slavers? *",

Connectors going between this plate and heading.. deeper into the chest?*\nHis deft fingers carefully withdraw a long manipulator pick from a toolset secreted within one of his coat\u0027s many small pockets. He twirls it around his fingers for a second, then ever so slowly and carefully uses it to gently move one wire slightly to the side to see behind it.\n\n*There\u0027s some kind of power relay, been rigged between the pressure plate and the chest\u0027s powerpack.... Ah, yeah, I see it. Krif, that\u0027s mean.*\n\nHe sighs deeply then coughs, sucking air back in before turning his head towards the group behind him.\n\n**\"Ok, nasty piece of work this. Any interruption of power, like pushing this release here, will cause this relay to go off.**\n**Now, this is a short range transmitter, and if I were a gambling man - which I can assure you I would be, if I had the opportunity - I\u0027d bet you anything that setting it off would activate that slave collar there.\"**\nHe points the manipulator tool towards Nadia and the ominous accoutrement, the menacing band around her throat taking on new significance.\n\n**\"Now whatever we do, we\u0027re going to have to be extremely careful about it.\"**",

We might need to get a control module, like the one that Twi’lek had.  Another possibility is that we substitute a different charged collar for the one Nadia is wearing.  Get the relay to attach to the decoy, and take off Nadia’s.   I’d use Derek’s, but I think that one is pretty much kriffed.” **\n\nSpeaking of Derek, another technician appeared in the doorway of the cell.

The adventure it all painfully reminds her of her old life. She smiles through the pain and looks to Nadia. \"**||You have a strong spirit my dear, As strong as tempered beskar. Your ancestors would be proud.||**\" \n\nShe looks to the group then the collar. A war waging in her mind. She\u0027s already revealed some of her abilities what\u0027s one more.

Its *only* job is to ping the collar\u0027s receiver frequency. It\u0027s a dumb tripwire. So... if the collar is offline... the trap has nothing to talk to. It\u0027s just a dead switch.\"**\n\nShe looks back at Wes, the full weight of the problem solidifying.\n\n**\"The collar... *that\u0027s* the problem. It\u0027s a standard Z-Sec Mark IV restraint. They have anti-tamper protocols. You try to cut it, short it, or hack it with the wrong code, and its last command is to discharge its entire power cell into the wearer.\"**\n\nShe glances at the smoking panel by the door and then back to the group, her voice dropping to a terrified whisper.\n\n**\"So, you can\u0027t disarm both at once. You have to go for the collar first. If you get it off her, the trap on the chest doesn\u0027t matter. But if you fail... Rask won\u0027t need an alert. He\u0027ll hear her scream.\"**",

Make her their pet, maybe their plaything.\"**\nHe turns his head slightly to look at the trapped chest and then back to her.\n**\"And all the while with a simple way out just waiting there, a chance to end it all by giving up.**\n**Or maybe they thought it would be funny if she didn\u0027t spot the trap, tries to open it while high and sets her own collar off.

He thought he\u0027d left this all behind, but the memories - he can\u0027t leave them behind.\n\nHe rises gingerly to his feet, not hearing what the newcomer is going on about. *Happy - sorry, Iyola - can handle that, she seems to have her head screwed on ok.*",

The stark reality of their situation—the approaching deadline, the lethal consequence of failure—seems to hit her all at once. Her face pales, but then, a flicker of something else crosses her features. A glint of resolve, perhaps born from the guilt of seeing Derek\u0027s body.\n\n**\"But... I\u0027m the only one who knows the bypass sequence for the failsafe,\"** she whispers, more to herself than to Iyola. She takes a deep, shaky breath and meets Iyola\u0027s gaze, her own fear now battling with a desperate sense of responsibility. **\"Okay. Okay. I\u0027ll try. But I need tools.**",

Believe me, I know.  Sorry you got caught up.”  **\n\n**“Since you, uh, work here, can you tell us how many other prisoners there are on this ship?  And why keep this particular prisoner, Nadia?  I’m not deeply familiar with their, uh, line of business, but wouldn’t they want to keep the enslaved people in decent condition?”**   *Who’d buy her in this state? *\n \nIyola turned and looked at Varda as the woman seemed to listen to something that Iyola herself couldn’t hear, then described the other members of the slaver ship.  *Not a Jedi, hmm?  *Unless she was totally making it up, which was possible though super-unlikely, she must have real Force magic too. So what was she?  Iyola made a note to investigate further.\n\n**“So what’s the plan?”** she asked the others.  **“Get back to the Venture with Nadia and whoever else needs to leave, like Misha here, and clear out?

Vekker and Jorr. Hired muscle. They\u0027re... stupid and mean. They mostly stand guard down here in the cargo hold when they\u0027re not on the rotation.\"**\n\nHer attention snaps to Iyola, latching onto her practical questions like a drowning person grabbing a lifeline.\n\n**\"No. No other prisoners.

Ever since they brought them aboard two weeks ago, everything\u0027s been about her.\"** She shakes her head, a look of profound confusion on her face. **\"I don\u0027t know *why* she\u0027s so valuable to Rask.

That\u0027s why they\u0027re so afraid of her. That\u0027s why they... keep her like this. To keep her weak.\"**\n\nHer eyes dart to the datapad still clipped to her belt. The timer on its screen is now glowing an angry red.\n\n**\"We\u0027re under three minutes,\"** she says, her voice rising in pitch with fresh panic. **\"Plan? The plan is to get back to your ship before this one turns into a death trap! We can\u0027t take this ship. Rask is on the bridge; he\u0027ll have locked down navigation and primary systems.

Through his worn mask, he speaks in a neutral tone.** \"I suppose the answer is straightforward, then; let\u0027s return to the other ship. I doubt that we have enough time to search for anything of value anyhow.\"**\n\nTurning back towards the hallway, he moves his hand to grab the group\u0027s attention. **\"The hallway that we came from appears to be clear, but we should be quick; I\u0027m not particularly keen to threading the needle on a volatile ship. We can further introduce ourselves and understand this circumstance later.\"**\n\n Vaeros still grimaces as the thought of he loss of his droid, Karnyx, and the unknown fate of R3-K4.

It does not stay.”**  His voice held a sense of urgency as in leaving it behind wasn’t an option.  **”You and Dryzan should be able to carry it easily?”** He said to Iyola. \n\n\nHe turned to Nadia, hooking his lightsaber to a ring on his utility belt.   Taking a steady breath he reached out to her within the Force before physically touching her.   He knew she had been tortured and that her body likely hurt all over.  He let his calm presence reassure her that he wouldn’t hurt her intentionally.   || **”Sister, I need to pick you up.   I know it will hurt but it will be the fastest way to get you off this hell hole you’ve been in.”** || He waited for some sort of acknowledgment and a couple of seconds later she raised her weary head up and looked at him.  She gave the tall Mandalorian a small nod of approval.  \n\n\nGetting the nod from her he quickly and gently moved to pick her up.  He first put one arm up over his shoulder and around his neck before placing his left arm behind her back and his right under her knees.   Gently lifting he shifted  her so that her head could rest as comfortably as possible against his left pauldron.   The one that had his clan sigil emblazoned for all to see.   The same one that she stared at oddly before.  **”Let\u0027s move.”**",

He settles her against his pauldron, her head resting near the sigil of his clan, and turns to lead the way out.\n\nIyola and Dryzan, meanwhile, move to the heavy durasteel chest. They each take a side, the metal cold and unyielding in their grasp. With a coordinated grunt, they lift it, its weight a cumbersome but necessary burden.\n\nAs Wes carries Nadia across the threshold of the cell, her unfocused gaze drifts from the safety of his armor and falls upon the still form slumped in the doorway.\n\nThe fog in her mind, for one horrifying, crystal-clear moment, shatters.\n\n\nA sound tears itself from Nadia\u0027s throat—a raw, keening wail of pure, undiluted grief. It is not a psychic scream aimed at anyone, but an uncontrolled, explosive release of every bit of pain, terror, and loss she has suppressed.\n\nThe Force erupts from her.\n\nThe emergency lights in the cargo hold flicker violently, then die, plunging the vast chamber into near-total darkness. The damaged, exposed power conduits hanging from the ceiling crackle to life, spitting brilliant, angry blue arcs of energy that illuminate the chaotic scene in strobing, violent flashes.\n\nThe other Force-sensitives feel it as a psychic shockwave—a raw, undirected wave of pure, agonizing power that staggers them.\n\nIn Wes\u0027s arms, Nadia begins to struggle, her passive weakness replaced by a frantic, desperate strength.",

He felt her chest expand as if she was sucking in air and what followed was a sound he’d never forget.   Her physical wail along with the raw psychic shockwave she emitted within the Force staggered him.   It caused him to take a haggard step to the side before he could recover.  The lighting once again flickered and dimmed to near total darkness as damaged power conduits did what they could to light the area with arching blue energy.  \n\n\nTurning to see what she was looking at, his heart fell and he silently swore.   They were leaving and made no attempt to gather up her friend and it caused her to begin to fight against him.  || **”Nadia, we will bring him.  Please don’t fight against me.  I give you my word we will bring him.”** ||  \n\nHe turned his body to Varda.  **”Varda, I know you have strength other than physical strength.  Can you carry him?”**",

Even with the helmet on, Del-Fin seems shaken. \n\n The Mandalorian asks Varda to carry the body - *how?* - but she declines.  She asks Vaeros to carry Derek, but right now Vaeros has their only light source.  Iyola eyes Dryzan.  He might be a lot stronger than he looks, but right now they just need to move, and Iyola’s tired of the dithering.\n\n**“Change of plans.  Dryzan, you grab the chest.   Misha and I will carry Derek back.”**  These sleemos probably barely fed him, and he doesn’t look like he is - *was *- that large of a guy, but it’ll be an effort.

She buries her face against his pauldron, her shoulders wracked with silent, shuddering sobs.\n\nIyola\u0027s sharp, practical commands cut through the group\u0027s hesitation. There\u0027s a shared grunt of effort as Dryzan takes the full, awkward weight of the durasteel chest, his muscles straining under the load. Iyola and a wide-eyed Misha move to Derek\u0027s body. Together, they manage the grim task of lifting the technician, his limbs stiff and uncooperative.\n\nThe retreat begins. It is not a run, but a grim, burdened procession through the strobing, sparking darkness of the slaver ship. Vaeros leads the way, the sole, malevolent crimson glow of his lightsaber carving a moving bubble of light out of the oppressive black. The red blade paints their faces in stark relief, casting long, dancing shadows that twist and writhe on the grimy corridor walls.\n\nThe only sounds are the rhythmic, heavy tread of Wes\u0027s armored boots, the strained breathing of Iyola and Misha as they maneuver their grim cargo, and the low, scraping groan of the chest Dryzan struggles to carry.\n\nThey pass through the empty airlock antechamber, leaving the unconscious form of Grist behind in the darkness. The transition from the filth and chaos of the *Aether* to the sterile, quiet rooms of the *Venture* is a palpable relief.\n\nWith the last of them across the threshold, the inner airlock door hisses shut behind them with a heavy, final *thud*. They are safe. For now.",

Her eyes, still wide and unfocused, stare up at the ceiling, but they aren\u0027t seeing it. She is lost in the wreckage of her own mind, her breath coming in soft, shallow hitches. A single, silent tear escapes the corner of her eye and traces a path down her temple into her matted hair. She says nothing. She does nothing. The warrior is gone and all that is left is a broken, grieving young woman.",

He physically felt the scar as he put his armor on but he had no recollection of how it happened.   It felt as if his memory was gone or a part of it at least.   \n\nHe looked back to a monitor where the Face of Eve was present.  **”Can we do both?  Start her with the hypospray and then transition her to the cryo chamber?  Unless she stays under while in there she’ll be under more duress if she wakes up not knowing what\u0027s going on.  She’s also a mess and should be cleaned up as well.  Can the Cryo unit do that as well?”**  He looked at the display that was showing her condition.  Everything looked on the low end of things.\n\n\nHe asked his question not even knowing if it made sense.  He was out of his element dealing with this Eve AI or whatever she was.

He reached out to her in the Force letting his presence also counsel her to relax more.  || **”Rest Nadia.  You’re safe and getting medical care.  I’ll be here when you wake up.  You’re not alone anymore.”** ||  He said softly in Mando’a as his own presence equaled what he had voiced.   \n\n\nHe looked back at the Monitor and the female face in the middle of it.   **”Eve based on your current analysis can you calculate how long the second part, the healing process may take?”**  Before she could answer he spoke again.   **”Also she’s Force Sensitive.   Not sure if that will factor into anything.”**\n\n\nNot waiting for her to answer he reached out and gently picked her up.  He was still curious of the feeling of familiarity he first felt when he sensed her.   She didn’t look familiar and he knew no one personally with her name.   It was a niggling feeling in the back of his head as he set her gently into the cryo chamber.  It felt as if he should know or at least remember yet with part of his memory gone he simply wasn’t sure.",

The consoles are dark, featureless slabs of obsidian-like material, free of the chaotic clutter of physical buttons and switches. The only illumination comes from the soft, ambient glow of the floor panels and the holographic schematic of the ship floating serenely in the center of the room.\n\nVarda enters, her low, rhythmic chant a starkly organic sound in the sterile, technological heart of the ship. She settles into the single, central command chair, its position offering a perfect, unobstructed view of the cosmos.",

Instead, a deep, resonant hum builds from the deck plates, a vibration that feels less like a machine and more like a held note.

The corridor ahead is a tube of absolute blackness until she steps into it, triggering the same automated lighting sequence as before. A section ahead illuminates in a dim, ghostly white, while the antechamber behind her is plunged back into darkness, leaving her isolated in a moving bubble of light. The silence of the ship is profound, broken only by the soft scuff of her own boots.\n\nShe comes to the first major intersection. To her right is the heavy, sealed door to the cryo-bay they just left, its designation stark above the frame. It looks like the entrance to a silent, sealed tomb.\n\nOn her left, another door is marked with a universal medical symbol. A faint, soft blue light bleeds from the seam beneath it, and a low, steady hum of active machinery can be heard from within—a sign of life in the otherwise dead ship.\n\nShe continues forward, the path taking her between two identical, unmarked doors facing each other across the corridor. As she approaches, the door on her right hisses open. Inside isn\u0027t an open bay, but a structured living space. Six neatly partitioned alcoves line the outer walls, each containing a single, sterile bunk and a personal locker. The center of the room is dominated by a block of smaller, sealed rooms, their purpose unclear from a quick glance. The door remains open for a moment before sliding shut behind her as the one on the left opens, revealing a perfect, silent mirror image of the first barracks. They are anonymous, empty quarters, their former occupants long since vanished.",

Grist\u0027s armored form is an immense dead weight, his heels making a low, scraping groan against the metal floor. It\u0027s a slow, exhausting, and slightly ridiculous struggle.\n\nWithout a word, Vaeros grabs one of Grist\u0027s heavy legs. Dryzan grunts in grateful acknowledgment. The task, now shared, becomes manageable. Together, they haul the huge man through the silent, flickering corridors, an awkward and grim procession.\n\nThey arrive at the medbay just as the main door hisses open from the inside. Wes stands in the doorway, his helmet now back on, his posture radiating a grim readiness. He gives them a single, sharp nod as they maneuver their prisoner past him toward an adjacent, open doorway marked with a simple security stripe.\n\nThe holding cell is as sterile and spartan as the rest of the ship—a small, white room with a single metal slab for a bunk. They dump Grist\u0027s unconscious form onto the slab in an unceremonious heap. The cell door slides shut with a heavy *thud* and the soft hum of a magnetic lock engaging.\n\nThe prisoner is secured. For now. The three men stand in the silent, white corridor outside the medbay, the immediate chaos of the last few minutes finally giving way to a tense, uncertain quiet.",

He ran through the possibility of another Mandalorian that was Force Sensitive.  The odds seemed improbable but stranger things have happened.    Either way he would find out anymore until later.   He reached out to her once again unsure if she was already in a cryo state.   Either way he sent the feeling that he would be back when she awoke and that she was safe.   \n\n\nGrabbing his helmet he secured it in place as he made his way towards the exit of the medical bay.   He was about to reach the doors when they opened unexpectedly.   Outside was Dryzan and Vaeros lugging the large form of Grist.  He could see that the large slaver was a handful for the two of them.   He gave them a sharp nod as they moved past towards the secure holding cell.  Hearing a loud thud as Grist hit the floor he waited for the pair to exit the cell.   There the three of them stood in the sterile, white hallway.   **”Thank you for taking care of him.  Is Derek back at the docking ring?  He needs to be properly taken care of.”**",

She feels warm sunlight on cool, polished stone. She hears the gentle, melodic sound of wind chimes stirred by a soft breeze. She sees, as if through a hazy memory, words carved into a monument: *Lyra Kryz. Administrator. Architect of the Accord.* The lingering emotions in this place are not of grief, but of a deep, abiding respect and a quiet, profound peace. It is the impression of a beautiful, final silence at the end of a symphony of a life well-lived.\n\nThe vision fades, leaving Varda with a sense of melancholy peace for her lost friend.\n\nBut as the connection to Lyra recedes, something else rises in its place. The very act of reaching out with the Force has stirred something wrong within her, a discordant note in the song of her own soul. A jolt of icy, alien cold shoots through her, a pain sharp and unfamiliar. This is not the familiar, seductive shadow of Dathomiri magic she has spent a lifetime mastering. This is a fractured, dissonant static, a feeling of broken glass grinding against her spirit.\n\nA sharp pain lances through her bones, and a wave of profound weakness washes over her, making her breath catch in her throat. She has her answer about Lyra, a sad but complete one. But now, alone on the silent bridge, she is left with a new, far more terrifying question about herself. What is this new, broken thing she carries inside her?",

She tucks the love and the admiration for Lyra and places it in that part of her mind. The place where on cold days and rain splashes against the window she let\u0027s herself mourn. \n\nAs she mulls over her friends daughter she flinches and lets out a cry of pain. She jumps up out of the seat a frown on her face as she bares her staff forward. Looking for the threat that attacked her. Then as she spins around the control room she realises that it came from within. She frowns again this time tinted with an anger. Can she not live in piece. Without things trying to hold them in her palm. She tries to sooth the jagged parts of her soul. She looks to the blue and white and speaks \"Eve, my dear. Do you have access to knowledge on the fate of an outpost, a trading hub in the outer rim. Created by Lyra Kryze? And if you can what became of the legacy?\"",

Who and what is Eve and the ship they were on.  Why were they here and then there was the biggest question that was bouncing inside his bucket.   Where was Marina and was she still alive?   He had always been able to sense her when he reached out.  No matter the distance they could still sense glimpses of the other.  The knowledge that she was still alive after Order 66 was a comfort for him.  He was hesitant to reach out not knowing how long he had been in cryo.   \n\n\nRounding the corner into the airlock antechamber he laid eyes on Misha and Varda.   Varda was looking at the young woman.   Misha’s eyes widened as the three of them came into view.   He could sense that she was uncertain and lost.  She had gone from a horrible situation into an unknown one.  Judging from the look on her face he knew that she was unsure if her circumstances had changed for the better.   \n\n\nHe gave the young woman a nod.  **”We’re here to get Derek and take him to the Medbay.   There is a preservation chamber there that will put him into stasis preventing further decomp.   He will be safe there for as long as needed.”**  He paused for a moment to let that sink in.   That her friend was going to be taken care of.  **”Nadia is in a medical cryo bed where Eve is seeing to her healing.   She could be in it for a half day while her physical injuries are tended to.   Her mental status from the ordeal could be a longer journey.  Your friends are being taken care of and you’re safe here.”**",

The man beneath the helmet is not the scarred, brutal-faced killer she might have expected. He is human, with a strong, disciplined jawline and tired, intense eyes that seem to hold the weight of a long, hard history. His expression is unreadable, but it is not cruel. It is the face of a soldier, not a monster. The simple, human act of seeing him lowers the immediate terror in Misha\u0027s chest to a more manageable, simmering fear.\n\nThe offer of care, of a plan that doesn\u0027t involve immediate violence, is so unexpected it leaves her momentarily speechless. She looks from Wes\u0027s face to Varda\u0027s patient gaze, her mind struggling to process the shift from captive to... something else. The promise of food and a place to lie down is a simple, powerful lure. She gives a small, shaky nod, unable to form a complete sentence.",

The body of the technician, Derek, still lies on the floor, a grim centerpiece. Dryzan and the robed man, Vaeros, stand near the antechamber entrance. And in the center of the corridor, the old woman, Varda, stands near the Mandalorian, who is holding his helmet under his arm, speaking quietly to the terrified tech from the slaver ship. The scene is tense, quiet, and poised on the edge of an unknown next step.",

He felt that it may only have been a matter of time before her usefulness wore out and she became a prisoner as well.  \n\n\nWhen his helmet was removed he saw her relax, seeing the person who was beneath the armor and not the impassive killing machine that many thought of when they looked upon him.   Her meek acceptance to the offer of help brought forth a small smile and a nod from him.   **”Alright let’s get Derek to the Medbay.”**  As he moved towards Derek Iyola came around the corner.   She looked like she had been crying and he could feel the emotions, somewhat under control simmering inside.   As she spoke of knowing the date.  She shifted quickly to the nutrient paste that Eve had mentioned and then quickly riposted to Derek.   \n\n\n**”Yes Iyola we’re taking Derek to the Medbay now.  There’s a unit there that will preserve him indefinitely until we know what Nadia would like to do with him.  Would you like to help?”**",

The texts I study designate your period as the \u0027Great Peace\u0027, a time when Republic corruption was tame and conflicts were rare; it is the last instance of consistent peace in the galaxy. \"**\n\nVaeros, glancing at the group, speaks again.** \"If you would like, I can enlighten you on the situation; hopefully, thinking through and understanding the era can help process, or focus on the new circumstance.

Then, after only months into my training, Order 66 changed everything.  The clones turned against the Republic.   Jedi and any who were allied with them were burned down and murdered by the clones.  Any Jedi and sympathizers were then hunted down by Darth Vader and the Inquisitors.

Ne did so but there was still a hidden anger dwelling beneath the surface.  **”If looking for answers as to how the galaxy is today, know that there is more than one side to any story.”**  He was done talking.  Derek needed to be taken care of and wasting breath on the past at the moment was a waste of time.

I\u0027ll give you a summarized explanation, but we can talk more after the side effects wear off.\"** Vaeros is not one to try comforting or socializing in general, but he feels an innocent tug, or rather, a shame; he is not entirely sure. Every time he thinks about being left behind by the Empire, that he\u0027s out of his time, that voice gets stronger and stronger. Making sure that his mask his clipped to his belt, he takes a deep breath, before speaking. \n\n**\"Look, my experience might be a little strong for some, and I\u0027d rather not get into a fight over it, but I hope you understand my piece of the puzzle. I won\u0027t be upset, if you disagree, so feel free to speak your conscience. I grew up in the Jedi Order, believed in its cause without a fault; my master, master Liora Dhen, was one of the purist Jedi I knew, but it felt wrong. The order prides itself on being an order of good, protectors, and practitioners of the light, but their actions were often a direct counter to it, often choosing politics and maintaining their vast funds over expending them for the good of the people.\" **\n\nVaeros scoffs, **\"They wouldn\u0027t even dare assist some of the only Jedi who acted past that clouded judgment and was shocked when it eventually came back into their face; the Clone Wars. It was a lit fuse that spiraled out of control; the people of the Outer Rim were fed up with feeding their credits into a bottomless pit, in which any money that\u0027s supposed to return to them is fed to their senators and the Coruscant elite.\"**",

        "content":  "Wes listened as the others asked the how’s and why’s of the last ten years since Order 66.  No, not ten years, nineteen years.  He listened as Vaeros began talking.  About how he had trained with the Jedi but became disillusioned with them.    That he could understand somewhat.   He wasn’t sure he would have made it with the main order.  He didn’t really fit the mold of a typical Jedi.  It was probably the reason he was sent to train with the Altisian Jedi on the Praxium ship Chu’unthor II.   They held true to the Jedi way with a few differences where the strict codes were relaxed.   What he did find was that they were dedicated and well trained.   It was a better fit for him with his upbringing.  \n\n\nHis demeanor changed when the inquisitor mentioned the beginnings of Order 66.  He stood taller.  Ore rigid when Vaeros said the Jedi initiated a coup against the Chancellor and the Republic thus ending a thousand generations of Jedi serving the Republic.    \n\n\nWes turned from the monitors that showed the states of both Nadia and Derek.   **”Where were you when Order 66 was initiated?”**  He said directly to Vaeros.  His deep voice was calm but there was an edge to it.   **”I was on New Holstice.  Where a monument stood for Jedi who had fallen in service to the Republic or simply passed on into the Force.   Memory moths, that held a piece of the deceased jedi’s presence, flew all around the us and the monument.   My Master and a few other Padawans were there paying our respects when the image of the Chancellor started being projected everywhere.   When it started I could sense and felt the coldness in the Force as I felt it shift.   The Emperor,”**  Wes said the name with an obvious level of contempt.  **”Stated what had supposedly happened.  How the Jedi betrayed the republic and he initiated Order 66.”**",

It was a day he had tired to forget as the immense feeling of loss and the physical scream he felt from within the Force washed over him once again.   The clones on pretense tried to arrest us.  **”There was blaster fire from the clones all around us in the square.   The Jedi historians were cut down by blasterfire.  Their death screams were not only heard but felt in the Force as they and thousands of other Jedi, padawans and younglings all over the galaxy were simultaneously murdered by the Emperor and the Empire.”**  \n\n\nHe was about to continue when Eve’s voice came across the ship\u0027s speakers.  They had roughly twenty-five minutes until they all suffered from the effects of the KX-7 treatment and the earlier hibernation sickness the KX-7 temporarily handled.   He looked away from Vaeros to the others.  He was obviously finished talking.   **”We don’t have long until we’re all in a world of hurt.  The barracks should be our immediate destination for what’s to come.”**",

There aren\u0027t many records of this type of Jedi, at least not on the scale he\u0027s venting about. Any remote Jedi Temples run by voluntary Jedi were often abandoned or converted into outposts for the Clone Wars. The remaining temples were scuttled and deleted from maps following the war\u0027s end. No trace of the Jedi, or any force religion, was to remain. There would only be the Empire.\n\n*I should hurry along and document this discussion before resting.* Vaeros rotates his head, cracking his neck. Sleep would be nice about now. ** \"I do agree, I think we all need the rest for what\u0027s to come.\" **",

Misha, still reeling, watches them with wide, uncertain eyes, then turns and slips into the medbay. She comes to a stop before the preservation chamber holding Derek\u0027s body, her reflection a ghostly image on the cold, transparent lid. She simply stands there, a silent, lonely vigil.\n\nWith the unspoken truce of mutual exhaustion, the rest of the group moves on. Following Dryzan\u0027s earlier path, they reach the two identical, unmarked doors of the barracks. The door to the right stands open, revealing the spartan living space within. Dryzan\u0027s presence is marked by a single drawn partition, a silent claim to one of the six outer alcoves. At the far end, Iyola\u0027s backpack and a spare pillow clearly mark one of the larger, private \"Crew Lead\" rooms as her own.\n\nWes, his face grim and set, chooses the barracks on the left. The door hisses open to reveal a perfect, silent mirror of the first. It is a space defined by function, not comfort. Six neatly partitioned alcoves line the outer walls, each containing a single, sterile bunk with a thin mattress pad and a personal locker. The walls are a neutral grey, the lighting soft and indirect. In the center of the room, a block of smaller, sealed doors promises privacy for the refreshers and the single Crew Lead\u0027s quarters. It is a place of profound emptiness.\n\nVaeros and Varda follow suit in finding their own berths, the door sliding shut behind them, finally granting them a measure of privacy. The clock is ticking down. With a shared, weary understanding, they each find an empty bunk. The adrenaline of the fight and the shock of their awakening are finally giving way to a bone-deep exhaustion. They have a few precious minutes of clarity left before the inevitable crash, a brief calm before the second storm hits.",

The puppet\u0027s strings are cut. The vibrant, jittery energy of the KX-7 vanishes in an instant, and a wave of exhaustion so profound it feels physical slams into them. Limbs that felt strong and capable moments before turn to lead. Minds that were sharp and clear fill with a thick, syrupy fog.\n\nAnd for those who had reclaimed it, vision snaps back to absolute, suffocating blackness.\n\nThe crushing weight of stolen sleep comes crashing down at once, pinning them to their bunks. They are blind again, weaker than before, and utterly spent. There is no strength left to fight, no will to question. There is only the low, indifferent hum of the ship and the silent, inexorable rush of the journey as the *Venture* carries its unconscious crew deeper into an unknown galaxy.",
