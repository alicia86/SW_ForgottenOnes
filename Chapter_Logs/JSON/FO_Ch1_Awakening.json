The tyrannical GALACTIC EMPIRE tightens its grip, its vast war machine seeking to crush the last embers of freedom. Against this overwhelming might, a fledgling REBELLION fights a desperate shadow war, their hope dwindling with each passing day.\nBut this is not the first time the galaxy has been torn asunder. Across millennia, great powers have risen and fallen, their histories rewritten by the victors and their truths lost to time. Whispers persist of a hidden conflict fought not for territory, but for the soul of history itself.\nNow, in a forgotten corner of the Outer Rim, an ancient vessel, long thought lost, drifts silently. Aboard the ghost ship VENTURE, a cryptic emergency protocol has been triggered, awakening a handful of souls ripped from their own eras—survivors of conflicts long past, preserved for a purpose they do not understand, and about to be thrust into a war that is not their own….",

For a moment, Wes is adrift in a calm, cold void, a feeling of disconnection so complete it steals his breath. He instinctively reaches out with his senses, not his ears or eyes, but with the part of him that his master, Chase Davion, had helped him nurture. He feels the thrum of a distant power source, the cold metal of an enclosure, and a deep, oppressive stillness.\n\nThen, the physical world crashes in. The weakness in his limbs, the sluggish pound of his own heart, and the stale, musty air filling his lungs. He opens his eyes and finds only blackness, a disorienting void that his helmet\u0027s HUD should have instantly illuminated. The lack of his helmet is the first violation.\n\nHe is enclosed, his bare shoulders brushing against the smooth, curved wall of a tube. As he pushes himself up, his muscles scream in protest. A sharp, phantom pain pulls at his abdomen, an echo of a wound he can’t remember. A slow, methodical search confirms the final indignity: his armor, his blaster, his entire identity is gone. He is blind, weak, and stripped bare, left with nothing but a warrior\u0027s discipline and a connection to the Force that feels as broken and wrong as everything else.",

His limbs are heavy, useless things, and a wracking cough echoes in the tight space he finds himself in. He tries to open his eyes, but the world remains a dizzying, pitch-black void.\n\nPanic, cold and sharp, begins to set in. He pushes out, his bare hands meeting the smooth, curved walls of some kind of tube. Where are his clothes? His coat? His blaster? His mind races, trying to pierce through a thick fog of memory. The last thing he remembers is a deal… a meeting… then nothing. He is blind, stripped of his gear, and trapped. For a man who has always relied on his wits and a quick escape, this is a nightmare realized.",

She opens her eyes to a void, but the physical darkness is less concerning than the one she feels within.\n\nHer senses, the ones beyond sight, extend tentatively. She reaches for the Force to see, but her second sight, once a source of clarity, is now a fractured lens, filled with static and echoes of pain. She feels the smooth, cold curve of an enclosure around her. A slow, aching movement confirms she has been stripped of her staff, her robes, everything. She is a seer without her focus, a witch without her talismans, left with nothing but the tainted power she carries inside her.",

Her heart hammers in her chest, but her limbs are heavy, unresponsive logs of meat. The adrenaline is there, but the body refuses to obey. She opens her eyes and finds only darkness, a suffocating, claustrophobic black that feels like being trapped under rubble.\n\nThe air is cold and stale. She tries to move, to push, but her muscles ache with a profound weakness. She feels the smooth, curved walls of an enclosure, a cage. For a thrill-seeker who lives for speed and open skies, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be trapped, blind, and powerless. A wave of frustrated anger rises in her throat as she realizes she has been stripped of everything, left with nothing but the ghostly sensation of a fall she can\u0027t place.",

A low, dissonant hum inside his own mind, the psychic static of a power source that has catastrophically overloaded. It is an infuriating echo. He opens his eyes to darkness, a simple physical problem that is secondary to the chaos in his own senses. He reaches out with the Force to perceive his surroundings, but his connection, usually a precise dueling blade, is now a fractured, unreliable torrent.\n\nThe weakness in his limbs is an indignity. The cold air is an impurity. He feels the smooth walls of his confinement and realizes with a surge of cold fury that he has been stripped bare. His uniform, his status, his lightsaber—all gone. He is not just a prisoner; he has been reduced to a mere specimen, an outcome his scholarly pride cannot bear.",

The shadows in her soul long chained, long buried rise like smoke in a windless room. The scar on her soul rises to meet it like an old friend. They revel and dance around each other like lost lovers.\n\n“We can fix you…”\n“Free you…”\n“Let you see farther than ever…”\n\nThe temptation is so close. Closer than it’s been in years. The dark speaks with a voice like velvet laced with poison, and her fingers twitch as if they might reach, might surrender. But then  A voice cuts through. Dry, tired and stern. “Varda, old friend. Really? Resorting to such measures already? Compartmentalise. Make a plan. You’re better than this.” Araden, the warrior chiding with the same annoyed fondness as always.\n\nThen another “The first rule of a diplomat,” Lyra’s voice lectures with crisp clarity, “is to never lose your head.”\n\nAnd softer still “Grandma? I thought you said… the darkness, the hate, was bad?” Lyrus. Her light. Her boy.\n\nThe final voice breaks her. So gentle, so intimate. “Varda, my love. Please… you know better. For all we worked for. Now is not when we break.”\n\nA tear slips down her cheek, and with it goes the crushing edge of panic. She chokes back a sob and forces herself to breathe. In, then out. Like it’s the last air she’ll ever taste. No. Not yet. Not ever.",

The surface is impossibly smooth, a single, continuous curve of what feels like reinforced glass or a crystalline polymer, cold to the touch. Where glass meets metal, the join is seamless, fused with a precision that offers no purchase, no hint of a latch or control panel.\n\nShe finds small, shallow depressions spaced at intervals along the inner wall, one near where her wrist might rest, another by an ankle. They are inert, their purpose a mystery. Her careful exploration yields only one truth: this is a cage of perfect, featureless design.\n\nThe low hum of the machinery remains her only companion, indifferent to her struggle and her resolve. The darkness does not yield. Nothing changes.",

What was bothering him wasn’t just the silence, it was the absence of everything else.    He couldn’t feel the presence of the father and his two children.   The three of them were on the run.  Trying to not be discovered by the Empire.   The son, the younger of the two children, was Force sensitive.    He had been hired to take them to… he couldn\u0027t remember.  Immediately he was on alert.   The absence of the memory was concerning as there was no reason for it.  \n\n\n Keeping his calm he focused.   A combination of Mandalorian and Jedi training was bright to bear on the situation.  Cold metal and the thrum of some distant power source reverberated his surrounding area.  A stillness, oppressive in nature, wrapped him in a cocoon.  Similar to the metallic one he did not yet know existed.  \n\n\nLike a punch in the gut his other senses started registering.  No, it was more like they were protesting their current state.   His heart felt like it was just waking up and the air that exited his lungs smelled stale and tasted even worse.  Opening of his eyes held two revelations.  The darkness didn’t subside and his HUD didn’t activate with the movement of his eyes.  *Where’s my helmet?*  He thought as a small but growing tremor of unease ran through his body.",

The thrum of the machinery is not uniform; it\u0027s a layered hum. There\u0027s a low, resonant drone that feels like the power source he first sensed, but beneath it, there is a fainter, higher-pitched whine—the sound of active cryo-circuitry, now in a standby or reanimation cycle.\n\nHis effort yields no escape. The metal remains cold, the darkness absolute, and the pain a constant, nagging reminder of his vulnerability. The silence outside his pod is unbroken.",

They had to be competent. No sloppy welds. No old-world rust. No charming panel held in place by hope and screws. Her captors had the audacity to be efficient.\n\nWith care and focus, she slips a thin thread of control outward, not a surge, but a probe, a tendril of her will uncoiling like a shadow across the polished interior. Her reach is cautious, quiet, tuned to the finer vibrations of structure and energy, like a whisper drawn through glass. It brushes the edges of the capsule.\n\nThe material is dense, layered. composite alloy reinforced with something she cannot name, but can feel. It hums with dormant energy, a low resonance designed to repel not just impact, but disruption. It isn’t simply meant to contain. It\u0027s meant to hold. \n\nShe lets her mind drift further, reaching beyond the interior shell, brushing along the pod’s exterior with quiet precision. Every movement is patient, methodical and desperate without showing it. Her probe glides along the smooth surface, searching for any irregularity: a seam, a fault, a crack in the cage’s immaculate design.\n\nThere has to be something. A hinge. A switch. A flaw. But there is nothing. No mechanical latch. No hidden clasp. No comforting clunk of machinery waiting to yield to a clever hand. The pod is maddeningly seamless, forged with an intent so clinical, so inhumanly perfect, it defies even her most honed instincts.\n\nStill, she presses on. Her will brushes over every inch it can touch, hunting for even the faintest protrusion, any node or raised surface her senses might interpret. Anything her mind can seize upon and twist open with effort or finesse.",

The constant, dissonant hum of his own fractured connection to the Force wars with the low thrum of the machinery, creating a cacophony of internal and external noise.\n\nHe pushes past it, casting his senses out not with finesse, but with raw, focused will. His perception slams against the walls of his prison. The material is, as he might have suspected, anathema to the Force—a dull, leaden weight in the cosmic flow, designed to insulate and contain.\n\nBut the *design*... that is something different. It is not the brutish efficiency of the Empire, nor the chaotic improvisation of the Outer Rim criminals he has hunted. The energy field sealing the pod is woven with a strange, almost biological harmony. The technology is ancient, impossibly so. It speaks of a philosophy of science he has only read about in the most forbidden of Jedi and Sith archives—a time when the Force was not just a power to be wielded, but a fundamental component of engineering.",

There is no reply.\n\nThe sharp sting in his eye from his own finger is a grounding, agonizing flash of reality, confirming the darkness is not a blindfold. The ringing from the impact of his head against the wall joins the pounding in his skull, a cacophony of misery.\n\nThe combination of panic, pain, and the futile physical effort is too much for his compromised system. A wave of acute nausea rolls through him, hot and swift. The acrid taste of bile rises in the back of his throat, and the world—the dark, featureless world inside his head—lurches violently. He collapses back against the bottom of the pod, his frantic energy spent, leaving him weak, dizzy, and trembling in the suffocating blackness.",

The air is sterile, sharp with the scent of ozone.\n\nThey are five strangers, isolated by their individual blindness but now united by proximity. Weakness is a universal language; every limb feels like it\u0027s made of lead, every breath is a conscious effort, and a deep, cellular cold clings to them. For the Force-sensitives, the room is a cacophony of pain and confusion— the fractured echo of their own damaged spirits, and the unsettling hum of the technology that surrounds them.\n\nThe silence between the machinery\u0027s hum is punctuated by the ragged cough of one, the shuddering breath of another. They are adrift in the same boat, blind, weak, and utterly vulnerable. The question, unspoken but hanging heavy in the cold air, is who will be the first to break the silence and discover they are no longer alone.",

No matter how hard he pushed nothing moved and all it did was to make already sore and screaming muscles even more irritable.  \n\nRealizing that using brute force was futile he sank back into his coffin.  *’This isn’t good.’*  He thought to himself.   No sooner had the thought finished a loud *hiss* cut through the silence causing him to startle as the seals released.   Different air rushed in.   He wouldn’t have said it was better as it was cold, recycled and smelled of ozone.  \n\n\nIt was then he felt the others and the sounds of other containers making the same drawn out hissing sounds as his container did.  He drew his Force presence in and laid still for a few seconds as his hand did what it could to cut down the sharp pain of the now intense lighting that stung his eyes.  His limbs felt heavy as he tried to move them.   As he bent his arms and legs he imagined a cracking noise as they moved. When he bent at the waist the pain in his abdomen shot through him causing him his head to spin.  \n\n\nIt didn’t take long for the silence to be broken.  What sounded like a body hitting the floor sounded out.  It was followed by a male voice swearing.  Wes noted the sound of the voice and where it was.   He already had an idea where the humanoid Was.  He wasn’t very focused but he could sense the position of the body off to his left crumpled on the floor.   \n\n\nHe took a deeper breath to talk and the effort was rewarded with a wracking cough as his lungs struggled to cope with the deep breath.   He started to talk but ended up coughing again.  Finally when he was able to take a small bit deeper breath he was able to find his voice.   **”It might be better to wait a moment before moving.”**  He said as loud as he dared not knowing who else was there or listening.  \n\n\nHe didn’t listen to his own advice as he continued to move his limbs attempting to move him to a seated position.",

She senses a space before her, and doesn’t even wait for the tube to finish retracting before she’s scrambling through on her hands and knees. She lets out her breath, a loud, shuddering gasp.\n\nThen she hears it - voices, movement.  Someone curses, a male voice.  Another voice cautions - a deep, low voice, another man, perhaps - that they shouldn’t move. \n\nIyola needs to move.  She crawls forward towards the nearest voice, the first one. Her hands span out, feeling the floor before her for drops or holes.  The metal floor is harsh on her bare knees.\n\n**“Hey, hi, are you OK?

The pod hisses open behind her, and she steps out into the stale, recycled air of a world she does not know. Her feet hit metal, too slick, too cold and a spike of vertigo shoots through her. She clutches her head as sound crashes into her all at once. Raised voices. Footsteps. The sharp shouts of fear. Chaos with the cadence of panic.\n\nShe sighs, rubbing her temple with a grimace. “**By the spirits... we all have the same headache,**” she mutters. “**Yet you’re all still screaming.**” Her voice is hoarse, dry as dust. It doesn’t matter. No one’s listening.\n\nShe reaches out, steadying herself against the nearby wall. Her knees threaten rebellion, and a wave of nausea rises like a tide to drown her. *So that’s how it’s going to be, *she thinks. Worse still, her cane is gone. The absence of its weight throws her balance further, like a limb missing, like a spell half-cast. The world tilts. Her breath comes measured, slow and shallow. She narrows her focus, tucking the pain into a quiet corner of her mind.\n\nAnd then, through the din, she listens. One voice then another and another still. Four, she counts. Distinct, though overlapping. All harried, all reacting. She files their tones, pacing, and rhythms into mental boxes. Names can come later.  For the moment she keeps to herself. waiting to see how the thread unravels.",

She draws the Force to her not in desperation, but with the deliberate grace of an old ritual. Her breath slows.\n\nThe battlefield calm. The silence of a mind balanced on the edge of the blade. That space where instinct and clarity become one. She sinks into it. Feels it take hold. Then, gently, she pushes it outward, Not as a command nor a shove. But a touch a wave of stillness unfurling through the room like warm mist. She threads it through the air, quiet and careful an offer, not an imposition. Like a hand extended, or the hush of an old lullaby. Like a knock at a door asking to be let in. Something that says: You are not alone. You are not in danger. Breathe.\n\nShe lets the wave pulse outwards and raises her voice slightly. \"**Peace companions. In this state we can\u0027t afford to be bubbling around the room like a pack of drunk rancours. We appear to not be in immediate harm. Let us all be calm. No one in this room means to cause pain.**\"",

Vaeros thinks,*She must be strong in the force to overcome this; the calming effect is minuscule, but nice. Wait, is that Jedi speech? Is that why it\u0027s so calming?

They could be helpful in finding her jacket. * She’s not leaving without it.  Another man suggests they go toward the portal, and that seems like as good idea as any.\n\nShe feels the movement in the stale air as the formerly panicking man crawls forward, and she steps to the side, hopefully out of his path. \n\nThen the voice emerged.  Eve.  Some kind of super-powered droid. *What the kriff was the Venture?  And how did she and the rest of them get here? *\n\n**“Eve,**” she asks, **“you said you woke us up.

The Mandalorians demeanor changed as he  sensed no obvious threat for those present and it sounded like they were all waking up from this hibernation and that it had been some time.  Immediately he thought of Marina.  How long has it been?  Almost as quickly as the thought of her entered his mind he tucked it away.  It was something he’d have to look into when their fat wasn’t in the fire.   \n\n\nIt was then he felt it.  As the old woman spoke he felt the subtle waves and her presence in the Force.  Now knowing where she was he looked directly in her direction.   His eyesight was still void of any details but the lower illumination no longer scalded his limited vision.  Instead of what looked like a bright sun he could now make out a fuzz that was more vague than anything else.  The calming presence shifted his mindset as he started looking around.  \n\n\nThe earlier angry male voice spoke again.  He was calmer this time.  His suggestion of moving towards the light seems to make sense.  He nodded but didn’t say anything as he slowly moved towards what seemed like the only light in his hazy vision",

Apparently it would help with the hibernation after effects and it sounded like they were going to need it.  Five unfriendlies were trying to board them.  And from the earlier info Eve had given them the five of them were the only ones on board.

This situation still has many unanswered questions, but he needs to first make it out of the situation alive. Firstly, he needs to get his injection, then his equipment. Based on the potential individuals here, when we get our equipment, he hopes that they don\u0027t understand the implications of the color red. He has enough to process right now. \n\nVaeros continues his unsteady walk towards the compartment holding the vial and grabs it with his hand. He\u0027s hesitant to take the injection, but it\u0027s to survive the intruders in the short term. \n\nVaeros tries to glance around the members near him, **\"Do you individuals have a name to go by? I think it\u0027s relevant to this situation; my name\u0027s Vaeros.\"** As he speaks, he cringes at the thought of forming connections in this situation, but it should ideally keep a minimum, positive relationship; just enough for the group to hopefully dissuade turning on each other if we make it. \n\nWaiting for their response, he stands idle, waiting for the group to move.",

A jolt of absolute, shocking cold shoots up his arm from the injection site, spreading through every vein in a fraction of a second. The deep ache in his muscles crystallizes, then shatters.

The fuzzy, indistinct darkness that has plagued him shatters into a million points of light, which then coalesce with painful clarity. For the first time since waking, he truly *sees*.\n\nHe sees the sterile, metallic cryo-bay they\u0027ve just left, the five open pods recessed into the walls. He sees the others: all of them in various states of undress. The old woman he has taken by the arm, her white hair braided, her expression grim but steady; the angry-sounding man, Vaeros, holding his own injector, his posture taut and suspicious; the younger woman, looking around with a mix of awe and anxiety; and the one who had panicked, still on the floor but now pushing himself up, his eyes wide with a different kind of shock.\n\nThe antechamber before them is short, leading to another heavy, sealed door. Along the walls of this small room are five recessed equipment lockers, each with a small, unlit biometric panel next to it. They are marked with simple, numeric designations: 01, 02, 03, 04, and 05.

The resulting rush was fantastic,* like drop-skiing down Mount Nistari at midnight*.  Plus, now she could actually really see the others here.  Two male humans who looked like they were accustomed to kicking ass (  *Vaeros and Del-Fin?  * Iyola wasn’t sure which was which), one guy with dark shaggy hair, probably the one she’d inadvertently terrified, and an older woman with white braided hair and incredible body art, Varda. **“I love your tattoos,”** she said to her. \n\nShe stepped toward the lockers, ready to reclaim her gear and deal with whatever Eve said was happening on this ship.  *Then she’d call Caz and they’d get out of here. He’d be furious at her for making him worry, but she’d make it up to him. *",

She pulls out the cloak first dark and worn, wrapping her in the comfort of identity. The fabric settles, hiding the tremble in her limbs. Then come the pouches small, precise tools of her trade. She ties them to her belt with deft fingers, each knot anchoring her more firmly in the present.\n\nFinally, she reaches for it. The cane, though it\u0027s more a staff, really. Crafted from dark grey and rich brown wood, its surface is etched with carvings that dance beneath her fingertips: storms in full fury, clouds roiling with motion, lightning split like rivers, and through them, owls, wings spread wide, flying between the chaos. Wisdom threading the storm.\n\nEvenly spaced along the staff are three rings of polished beskar, A metal with a dull gleam in the light. Each one is etched with the same intricate runes and sigils that mark her own skin. a harmony of metal, wood, and self.\n\nShe draws it free with both hands, holding it reverently, as if greeting an old friend. Relief flickers across her features she takes a slow breath. She leans on it, finally having her anchor once again. Then, with quiet deliberation, she taps the cane against the floor. Once. Twice. Thrice. Each tap releases a hum, low and resonant, like a tuning fork struck by time itself. The beskar rings sing in harmony, a layered chord of storm and steel.\n\nShe turns to Iyola. a small twinge at the side of her mouth, the crows feet deepen as she regards her. \"**Ahh, why thank you. They were a right of passage. It\u0027s been so long now I sometimes forget they\u0027re there**\" She lets out a small chuckle.",

It feels like coming home.\n\nBut as they take inventory, a subtle and unsettling wrongness becomes apparent. Any datachips or datapads they owned are present, but their memory has been wiped clean, formatted to a factory default. Any holocrons, those precious repositories of unique knowledge, are simply gone.\n\nAnd their credits, the universal currency of the galaxy, have been replaced. In their place non-descript synth-leather pouch. Inside, a small collection of cut gemstones—lustrous sapphires, fiery opals, deep green emeralds—clinks softly together. They are clearly valuable, but their origin and purpose are a complete mystery.

He decides to follow along, and he looks for his locker. \n\nReaching his respective locker, it glows, clicking open as the locks disengage. He first dresses in his black vacuum suit, with Imperial insignia on both upper arms, then wears a black robe and pants over it. Once his clothes are on, he fastens his cortosis gauntlets on his forearms, a wrist-mounted commlink,  a utility belt around his waist, and attaches an inquisitor\u0027s mask to it. Once it\u0027s in place, he triggers the vacuum seal on his suit and turns on his commlink, with a chirp indicating its operation.\n\nReaching into the locker again, he realizes something is critically missing: his holocron, his prized possession granted to him during the Clone Wars under Dooku\u0027s group of Dark Acolytes. His data pad and credit chips work, but they are missing his notes, maps, and banking information. In place of it is a pouch of luxury jewels.

With a cursory glance he looked inside.   It all appeared to be there.  His Beskar\u0027gam and blaster were prominent as well as his other gear.   \n\n\nTaking a breath he reached for the black body suit he wore beneath the armor.  It pulled on easily which only spurred him on faster.   Boots went on next followed by his leg armor.  Each piece was placed and attached with a practiced efficiency that only came from years of repetition.   As he let the chest and back plates settle onto his shoulders it became obvious as to what he was.   Mandalorian.  A familiar metallic sound from something Varda tapped against the deck plating caught his attention.  It was the sound of Beskar.   He spotted her cane and the three pieces of Beskar that adorned it.   He raised an eyebrow wondering but knowing that this wasn’t the time.  \n\n\nBeyond her he saw Vaeros attach a lightsaber hilt and an inquisitor mask to his utility belt.  He stood up quickly looking at the man.  Taking note of his appearance.   He took a deep breath as he fought to keep control of his emotions and his Force presence in close as to not give himself away to the enemy.   The one he’d been on the run from for over a decade.  His eyes spoke what words didn’t.   And he knew it would have to wait.   *’The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  For now.’*  He thought as he reached for his bucket and pulled it on over his head.   His blaster and utility belt were next. As he looked them both over before adding the rest of his armor.  He looked over his arm vambraces and nodded satisfied that all was in order.  That his lightsaber was still hidden within the right vambrace.    \n\n\nHe stood almost two meters tall now.   His hand resting on the grip of his blaster pistol.   The HUD in his helmet giving him information on his surroundings.",

It must have meaning to you….  Did you make it?”** She peeked at the runes on it to see if she recognized any of them.\n\nFinding her own locker, Iyola gratefully grabbed her gear, pulling on her pants, boots, belt, and harness, strapping on her ascension gun, and, of course, her beloved turquoise-green synthleather jacket. \n\nA younger blond man was dressing himself in a very impressive dark-hued ensemble - black cape, metal bracers, with some kind of gear-like symbol that Iyola didn’t recognize immediately. *It would likely come to her soon enough. *\n\nHe introduced himself as Vaeros. Iyola smiled back with one of her sunniest smiles.  He was pretty cute. She couldn’t help but notice the lightsaber on his belt.  **“Hi Vaeros, it’s good to meet you**,” Iyola said  **“Glad to have a Jedi with us in this kind of situation. And, I’m sure, other situations too.” **\n\nThe tall, muscular man - this one must be Del-Fin, then - was dressing himself with great care in metal armor.  Looked like the traditional costumes she’d seen  in Keldabe, on the outer rim planet of Mandalore.  It was interesting to see the complete kit in action.  \n \nThe scruffy, dark-haired man looked a lot happier after the drug injection.  He was wearing absurd red goggles. *He looked like he’d be a lot of fun, or trouble, or both.  * Dryzan - that was his name - asked them all if they were ready to kark things up.  Iyola laughed a bit, which felt good.** “I mean, not on purpose, but maybe” she replied.**",

Vaeros, now clad in the severe black of his old life, carries an air of cold analysis, while Iyola\u0027s natural curiosity and bright energy begin to reassert themselves.\n\nVarda stands a little apart, the ancient wood of her staff a grounding presence in her hands. The runes are unfamiliar to Iyola\u0027s eyes, their patterns ancient and alien, unlike any script she\u0027s seen in Republic or even Outer Rim archives. They seem less like writing and more like a map of natural forces—the flow of wind, the crack of lightning, the spiral of a galaxy.\n\nAs the last piece of armor is buckled and the last weapon holstered, the sterile silence is broken by a chime. On the wall behind them, a large holographic display flickers to life, drawing their attention.",

The bright blue synthweave jacket, cut bold and modern, practically glowing under the sterile light. The one clad in dark, practical layers, a lightsaber resting at his hip and lastly, the figure in the broad, heavy trench coat with a humorous quirk to lips. She studies each of them with a silent, appraising eye. \n\nHer thoughts drift like smoke, but she anchors them with a smile as Iyola admires her staff. “**Aye, I did,**” Varda replies, pride softening her features. “**It took many weeks of carving, of long, patient work. But I’ve no regrets. The storm teaches patience, and in the end, I’m content with what it’s become.”**” Her fingers brush the storm-carved wood as she speaks, and then, without hesitation, her eyes flit to Iyola’s attire. “**That jacket of yours is finely cut, dear. The colour suits you well, it catches the light like water across stone. Makes your complexion glow**”\n\nShe turns as Vaeros speaks, Varda gives a small nod of agreement at the suggestion of comlinks. She moves with quiet steps walking forward and offering each of them her personal signal in turn. Then, with a smooth motion, she places her own in the crook of her ear. The small device hums faintly as it activates. \n\nBusiness handled, her gaze drifts toward the projection. the image of the intruders. Her expression shifts. A deep line creases her brow. Her lips press thin. She wonders *Why this ship? if from what I\u0027ve seen we\u0027re a handful of nobodies locked in stasis. What reason do they have to board?*",

That feeling you get when you return to a familiar place, only to find the walls repainted and the floorboards slightly out of place. The bones of it remain, but the soul has shifted.... She sees it then, not with her eyes, but with the deep sense that has guided her longer than either of them have likely lived.\n\n*How strange...There’s something in the way they hold themselves. Not the set of shoulders or the stance of their feet, but in the Force. Their presences are tight, drawn inwards like silk thread pulled taut. Woven too fine like they\u0027re shielded or...or they’re hiding?* she realises.\n\nShe remembers the younger sisters, long ago those first initiates who trembled through their meditations, uncertain and raw. When fear gripped them, they would coil inward, stifle their light, as if to keep the galaxy from hearing them breathe. *Perhaps,* she wonders. *These two never had the guided hand of a stable teacher. Or worse, perhaps they were taught by someone who believed fear was strength, or silence was safety.*",

We did not clutch it to our chests like secrets waiting to be stolen.*\n\nAs the others begin to prepare, checking weapons, adjusting gear, sharpening focus. She reaches outward, with a series of soft, playful tendrils. Thin wisps of her presence spun like threads of silk into the current of the Force. She touches Vaeros first. Just a brush. Like tapping the surface of still water with the edge of her thought. *Why so taught?* Then Del-fin, with a gentler nudge. A coaxing flicker. *Are you there?*\n\nShe prods here, tugs there, spins her presence around them like an eager puppy. It’s the same game she used to play with the younger sisters in the halls of Ichor. teasing, almost, but always with purpose. *Come on, her presence whispers, light and wry. Just a little spark. Let me see how you shine.* It\u0027s been many years since she encountered another force user. But to see them so confined makes her rage on the inside. It makes her want to see them truly be free",

His speech reminds her of the administrators and professors in her family, and his bow is formal.  She wonders where he’s from.  *Maybe Chandrilla?*  His suggestion to share the comlink signals is a good one.\n\nIyola pulls out her comlink from one of her multiple pockets. Instinctively, she flips to Caz’s code - maybe there’s time to send him a quick all-clear-  *it’s blank*.  She stares at the com for a click, then cycles through the other codes.  *Mom, Dad - sisters, friends, they’re all gone. * She draws a quick, sharp breath, and her hand shakes a bit.\n\nShe swallows hard.  She has contingency plans.  She’ll deal with this later. She shares her comlink information with the others, and then *she’s got to do something*.\n\n**“Hey, Eve, can you download the schematic to my datapad and mark the fastest route?” ** She turns to the others.  **“We can get to the inner door before they enter if we’re fast enough, but we’ve got to go now.” **",

It then fades into another haze, a blonde Jedi kneeling at an older, bearded man clad in a brown cape. The Jedi proudly displays his Lightsaber, now red, but it shifts again; The defeated Jedi, now in black, kneeling in defeat against a black-suited man. The man is the purest form of darkness imaginable. With the thought of him escaping from Vaeros, he instinctively shuts himself off from the unknown intruder. \n\nVaeros shutters, instinctively force pulling his lightsaber to his right hand. He glances around until he notices that Iyola is organizing the team, **\"Sure, Iyola, I\u0027ll be right behind you.\"**",

The path looked pretty straightforward and with Eve locking all other doors it should be even easier.  **”Lets not wait.”** He stopped talking as soon as Vaeros’s lightsaber found its way to his hand.

The air here is colder, the silence deeper. It is a ghost ship, a place of long-dormant machinery and forgotten purpose.\n\nAs they step forward, the section of the corridor immediately ahead of them flickers to life. Dim, white emergency lights embedded in the floor and ceiling cast long, distorted shadows, giving the hallway an eerie, spectral glow. The metal walls seem to absorb the light, making the space feel both illuminated and deeply shadowed at the same time.\n\nThey press on, a strange collection of figures moving through the silent ship—a hulking Mandalorian, a robed Inquisitor, a wiry scoundrel, a brightly-clad scout, and an old woman leaning on an ancient staff. As they pass the midway point of the lit section, the lights behind them extinguish, plunging the path they\u0027ve just walked back into absolute darkness. Simultaneously, the next section of the corridor ahead illuminates, beckoning them forward.\n\nHeavy bulkhead doors block their path at intervals. As they approach, each door slides open with a whisper of hydraulics, revealing another identical, dimly lit section of corridor, only to hiss shut again once the last person has passed through, leaving them with the unsettling feeling of being drawn deeper into the ship\u0027s heart, with no easy way back. The only sound is the soft scuff of their boots on the deck plating and their own measured breathing.",

It\u0027s a ship meant for life, but now lays hauntingly void of it.\n\nShe pauses once. Then again. A hand placed delicately on a bulkhead where her breathing slow, steady, as if catching herself. To the untrained eye, she looks exactly as she intends: an older woman, weathered by years, taking a moment to gather her strength. But to those with sharper senses, those who know what to watch for, those trained in this exact art know there’s something else beneath it. This image of an older woman is exactly that, an image. A subtle performance. A shield. She leans into the illusion with the precision of someone who has used it before. *Let them underestimate me now,* she thinks, *and regret it later if they must.*\n\nEach time someone glances her way, she offers a warm, patient smile, gentle, grandmotherly. The image is convincing. Comforting, even. But as the ship’s lights flicker that crimson red. The warmth fades from her expression. Her pace quickens, cane tapping more sharply against the floor. Her posture straightens. The mask does not drop, not entirely, but the edge behind it shows.",

Since his data pad no longer has a copy of his original texts, he has to retype what he can by memory before he eventually forgets bits and pieces. A snippet of text catches his eye, as he reads what he wrote, *Regardless, Varda is strange; why does an elderly woman wish to fight these intruders? She looks frail, winded, but still manages to keep up with the group. Strange.* As he walks, he thinks over the texts about this group and their respective quirks. What makes them tick? \n\nAs he continues to jot things down, he remains torn between his conditioning and personal desires to learn and explore this new opportunity. Should he try a different path?

As they set off for the inner door, the older woman  seemed calm and unconcerned,  as if they were all out for a Zhellday  stroll.  Her eyes, a purple color, were bright and kind, and she smiled warmly at Iyola when she looks her way.  Iyola smiles back.  Despite her age, Varda was keeping up with the group just fine, and didn’t appear to need any assistance at the moment. \n\nVaeros has put on a strange mask, severe, angled, and elegant.

A wave of pressure washes over all of them, a sudden, gut-wrenching vertigo that makes the floor seem to tilt.

Something infinitely worse:\n\n|| A psychic shriek of pure, unadulterated agony slams into their minds. \nIt is not a thought, but a raw, sensory onslaught—a spike of ice-cold terror driven through their skulls. The impression is a chaotic, layered torrent of torment, flashing by in an instant: There is the physical violation—the feeling of being pinned down, limbs held fast by overwhelming, brutal strength. The sharp, lingering spasm from the directed energy of a stun collar, followed by the dull, sickening thud of a physical blow. \n\nWoven through it is an agonizing low where every nerve ending is scraped raw and screaming for a poison it has been taught to need. Then the jarring rush of a new injection, a thick, syrupy numbness that smothers the sharp edges of pain, replacing it with a disorienting, hollow float. This, too, is a violation—the feeling of one\u0027s own will being chemically drowned, only to be ripped away again, leaving the agony of withdrawal even sharper than before. \n\nThey can feel the greasy, leering satisfaction of a predator, the callous amusement of onlookers, and the bitter, metallic tang of blood and fear in the air. It is the psychic echo of a will being systematically, cruelly, and repeatedly broken through every means available. \nBut through the storm of pain, drugs, and violation, a single, focused point of light remains—a core of incandescent, defiant rage. It is a desperate, silent plea for **help**, a final, focused beacon from someone who refuses to be completely extinguished. ||\n\nThe wave lasts only a second, but it feels like an eternity. Then, it is gone, leaving behind a ringing silence and the phantom ache of another\u0027s torment.\n\nThe source is undeniable: it is coming from the other side of that airlock.",

He was still shaken from the onslaught of emotions as he tried to stand straight as he took another step.  ***”We\u0027re coming!”*** He projected this thought and feelings out into the Force no longer caring about his company.   \n\n\n**”Someone needs our help, Dryzan.”**  He said with a raspy voice as he drew his blaster taking uneven steps towards the airlock.",

One trembling hand clamps against her temple, the other clawing for balance that will not come. Her cane goes skittering across the floor. \n\nWhen she looks up, her eyes are glassy with tears welling, uncontrolled. She is drowning. Drowning in the sudden, crushing tide of emotion, that itself opens a dam inside her and lets every buried scream flood to the surface. Her legs feel distant. Disconnected. Useless beneath her. She clenches her eyes shut. Desperately trying to escape, trying to shut it out, the pain, the pressure, the overwhelming presence. But even that brings no peace. She teeters between two agonies: The dominating will of something vast and merciless crashing into her… And the terror of cutting herself off. Of silencing one of her most vital senses, of becoming blind in the dark. She shudders, caught between the instinct to survive and the fear that to protect herself. \n\nShe falls deeper into herself. The gnawing void of helplessness claws at her spirit, and around it coils a sick, gleeful amusement. Not hers. Never hers. A shadow whispering that she is small, broken, lost. She trembles. But then...Light.\n\nIt bursts through her like a supernova. She doesn’t know its source. She doesn’t care. She latches onto it like a drowning woman to driftwood, gasping against the current. She seizes the moment. With tears still staining her cheeks, with her limbs still trembling and her body rebelling, she jabs a hand toward the floor. Her cane, her staff, flies to her grip, called with a snap of authority. The carved wood slaps against her palm like a memory returned.",

It is the fury of storms, of mountains groaning under strain, of wildfire sparked by injustice. A righteous resentment at the taking of will. Her presence in the Force changes. Where once it flowed playful and curious like a soft breeze drifting through the corridors, it now begins to gather, building with a rising pressure. A wind before the storm.\n\nwith the proclamation from Mandalorian, She marches forward. Unsteady and rickety but all together moving forward.",

His hand was still upon the wall for support.  Memories of the Purge bounced around in his head.  The sudden loss of life that followed Order 66 was still a distant scar of a memory.  One that he would never be rid of.  While this was different it was no less powerful to him.  The person was still alive but the despair and pain was overwhelming.  Whoever it was it felt that they had been subjected to torture for some time.\n\n\nWords from Dryzan cause him to focus on the here and now.  He pushed off the wall with his hand finding his feet mostly steady.  He looked towards the others.  Varda had made it to her feet as the others were doing so as well.   The old woman surprised him.  She was following and he could feel the shift in her presence.  In it he felt a promise of retribution for what had just happened.  He gave her an approving nod as he looked at Dryzen.  The cold unnerving visage of his helmet was the only emotion that could be seen.  He held the man\u0027s gaze for a second before speaking.  **”I am no Jedi.”**  His voice was heard over the comms.  His voice, like his armor, sounded hard after the emotional onslaught that they had all just suffered. \n\n\n**”Iyola, Vaeros?”**  He said as he saw them recovering from what they had just experienced.  **”You ready.”**  He asked, needing to be sure they were good as a group to face off against these pirates and whatever else was aboard.",

This is the second guy she’s freaked out today.  *She must be much more intimidating than she had realized.*   He takes off the strange mask, and smiles at her, or tries to, like it’s something he doesn’t do a lot.  *It’s a good attempt,anyway.*  \n\n**“Oh, I see. That’s smart. I was worried that you were writing up some kind of Council report on us,”** she  said.  When he asked in his formal manner if she needed anything, she shrugged. ** “Just to repel these invaders, explore the Venture, then ping my boyfriend and get back to my ship,”** she explained. \n\nAny further conversation was cut off as they rounded the corner. \n\n   A wave of awful sensation overcame her -  she’s helpless, agonized, nauseated. Her limbs feel like they’ve turned to ice.  A strange ringing sound fills her ears - it sounds like screaming.  Iyola lurches towards the nearest wall to steady herself, slips, sits down hard.  She feels horrible.\n\nThe sensation recedes.   Her cheeks are covered in cold tears and snot. \n\nShe looks around, rising to her feet, and sees that others had experienced something similar.  She hears Dryzan, the man with the red goggles, curse and mutter, and sees him draw his blaster.  Iyola uses the edge of Vaeros’s cape to wipe her face off.  It doesn’t work that well - the fabric is coated with something impermeable and unpleasantly scratchy.   \n\n Del-Fin asks in his harsh martial voice if they’re all ready for the fight.  Iyola nods and draws her gun. It’s oversized in order to accommodate its ascension function, but it also happens to pack a real punch. Since she’s going ranged first, she situates herself near Dryzan, to help cover him and Varda. \n\n**“Mandalorians don’t even like Jedi,”** she whispers to Dryzan.",

His hands, raw and scraped, tremble uncontrollably as they work with a frantic energy, pulling wires and bypassing circuits on the inner airlock door\u0027s control panel. It\u0027s a tremor that speaks not just of fear, but of exhaustion and withdrawal.\n\nAround his neck is a thick, metallic collar, a single red light blinking on its surface like a malevolent eye.\n\nThe purpose of the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s remote is now brutally clear. It\u0027s not a remote detonator. It\u0027s a leash.\n\nSparks intermittently fly from the damaged panel, casting fleeting, harsh light on the technician\u0027s face.

The door technician is most likely a slave, so we should set our goal towards removing the intruders and getting information from the man.\"**\n\nAs he speaks, he pulls the lightsaber into his right hand, keeping it unignited.",

He reached out to the man with the Force.  He sensed the man and swirling emotions that plagued the human.  What he didn’t sense was his active presence in the Force.  He wasn\u0027t the one that reached out to them.  \n\n\n**”He’s not the one that reached out.   There’s another on board their ship somewhere.”**  \n\n\nHe looked over at Vaeros who offered a suggestion.   **”I have no love for slavers.  Odds are if Eve hadn\u0027t woken us up they would have found us and they would be our captors.   If we don’t stop them that will also be the case.”** Wes didn’t trust the Inquisitor but for the moment he knew that the man didn’t want to end up a slave.  **”On their ship we will not have the advantage of knowing the surroundings.   At least here we are on equal footing and we have Eve.  There is still the one who reached out.   They are still on the slaver ship.”**",

With a sharp, powerful hiss, air begins to equalize between the two ships, the sound momentarily drowning out all other noise in the corridor.

The elderly woman Varda wisely decided to remain out of close range.\n\nJust then, the door integrity began to fail. Iyola decided she was still too close; she didn’t want to interfere with the hand-to-hand combatants.  She noticed a panel just behind her that would make solid cover.  It was too loud to speak. She ducked behind it, gesturing for Varda to get behind her, as she lined up her sight lines towards the portal.\n\n*Am I supposed to kill these beings?  *The thought sat uneasily on her.

The Mandalorians\u0027 hand twitched involuntarily at the inquisitor’s movement.  When Vaeros mentioned that the two of them would handle things up front while the others provided cover fire he took a deep breath.   That same breath was held in surprise when he heard the *snap-hiss* of the lightsaber and watched as the red blade sprang forth.   It was solidified then, he was going to have to fight alongside the agent of the Emperor.  Ones who had been sworn to hunt down those like him.  Yet something was different about Vaeros.    He had always been able to stay one step ahead of the Empire and its minions thus making this his first interaction with an inquisitor.   Under the circumstances he wished it was not the last meeting for either of them once this was over.  \n\n\nHis heavy boots sounded out across the deck plating as he walked up towards Vaeros and stood to his left side and looked at the others.    **”Vaeros is right, we will take the lead.  The rest of you cover us.   Varda however you can help us with your ability will be of great value.”**  Wes didn’t outright say he had a feeling she could do.   In the present times that was up to her to reveal.   His head swiveled back to Vaeros as he holstered his blaster.   He held the look as he released his grip on it while simultaneously activating the secret compartment on the inside of his right vambrace.  With his left he removed a cylindrical object that would look similar to the one the dark one held who stood next to him.  As the vambrace closed he switched the weapon to his right hand.",

With a guttural snarl, Vex lunges forward, his vibro-ax swinging in a vicious, overhead arc aimed to cleave the Inquisitor in two.\n\nVaeros stands his ground, calm and precise. His crimson blade flashes up, meeting the descending ax not with brute force, but with the elegant, economical motion of Makashi. The crackle of energy against cortosis-weave metal fills the corridor. He deflects the blow, but the sheer momentum behind it drives him back a step, a sharp pain lancing through his side. Before Vex can recover, Vaeros twists his wrist, turning the parry into a fluid riposte. The tip of his lightsaber scores a deep, smoking gash across the Twi\u0027leks\u0027s shoulder, and a hiss of surprise and pain escapes the slaver\u0027s lips.\n\nBefore the enforcer can fully register the counter-attack, Wes closes the distance. The Mandalorian\u0027s green blade moves in a tight, efficient arc, slicing across Vex\u0027s exposed flank. Staggered between the two lightsaber-wielding figures, the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s eyes widen.\n\nFrom the relative safety of her cover, Iyola lines up a perfect shot. A brilliant blue bolt of energy erupts from her blaster, striking the enforcer square in the chest. He seizes up, his body convulsing as the stun charge courses through his system, his predatory grin replaced with a grimace of neurological shock.\n\nPressing the advantage, Vaeros steps forward again. His crimson blade dances with deadly precision, a swift thrust that bites deep into the Twi\u0027lek’s other shoulder. The enforcer roars, a sound of pure fury and agony.",

It is the cold, dispassionate sound of a predator stating the obvious terms of engagement. The threat isn\u0027t angry; it\u0027s factual, and that makes it all the more chilling.\n\nThe words land like ice water on the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s panicked mind. His eyes dart from the unblinking red lenses of Vaeros\u0027s mask to the steady green blade of the Mandalorian, then down at the trembling technician in his grasp. The logic is brutal and undeniable. These weren\u0027t soft-hearted heroes; they were killers. Why *would* they care about this one piece of meat? His shield was worthless.\n\nFor a split second, the Twi\u0027lek\u0027s resolve crumbles. The offer of life, any life, is a hook he can\u0027t ignore.\n\nWith a final, desperate snarl, he shoves the hostage violently forward. The technician stumbles, crying out as he trips and falls sprawling onto the deck plating at Wes\u0027s and Vaeros\u0027s feet.\n\nThe distraction is all the Twi\u0027lek needs. He doesn\u0027t wait for a reply. He turns and bolts, disappearing into the dark corridor of the ship from which he came. The sound of his frantic, retreating footsteps echoes back into the antechamber.\n\nThe immediate standoff is over. The hostage is free, but the enemy is escaping.",

It was deathly quiet after the chaos of the first action of battle.   The only two sounds in the quiet was the low hum of the two lightsabers casting red and green shadows.   He then saw the will to fight leave the slavers eyes as the tech was pushed forward violently a split second before he tore off back into his ship.   \n\n\nQuickly Wes moved to the fallen tech who was now sprawled out on the deck plating.   Kneeling down he kept his blade to the side as he rolled the tech over.  Wes could tell that he wasn’t the one who had reached out before.    **”Hey.  Be calm.  Listen to me.   Someone on that ship reached out with the Force.   It wasn’t you.  Who was it that reached out?  Where are they?  Tell us and we can free you and whoever else they are holding.”**",

His senses reached out towards the aft of the slaver ship searching for the one that was mentioned.  There was a sense of urgency in his search.   They were about to enter an unfriendly ship and their time frame was unknown.   \n\n\nHe could sense the fear of the Twi’lek as he raced towards the front of the ship.  The cockpit perhaps.  Near the aft of the ship he felt her, Nadia.  The one who unleashed the psychic scream was now just a flicker of flame, a candle in the breeze.  That small flicker felt as if it could be sniffed out at any moment.   Along that area he senses the tech that had just left them in fear.  He was heading her way.   He was about to turn when something else stood out.   Another presence, one that was quiet as if it wanted to remain hidden.  The presence was along the path that the Twi’lek was taking.   \n\n\nHe turned towards the group.   **”This Nadia who he spoke of is in the aft cargo hold.  I can sense her there.”**  He said matter of factly as he raised his left hand in that direction.  **”He’s racing there right now.   The slaver is going towards the fore of the ship.  There’s someone else along his path.   They are trying to remain hidden.”**",

And somehow - was it Varda, perhaps? - the gigantic gunner had collapsed in a pile of flesh and flak armor.  *Were they all Jedi?  Dryzan too? Or could you use a lightsaber without being a Jedi?*  She’d only seen one lightsaber lit prior to day, and that hadn’t been in combat; it was when Lagan finally succumbed to her pleading and let her ignite and hold his weapon.\n\nShe remembered how weightless it had felt in her hand, and its beautiful icy blue color; he’d stopped her before she could twirl it around.  Now that she’d seen them used, she could understand why, but she’d been disappointed, and still was.  *Maybe that meant she could get a lightsaber for herself. It would be super-useful for ship repairs too. *\n\nTo her surprise, the technician had fled back into the ship. *They were scarier than whatever was on their vessel.* The thought was heartening.\n\nHer brow furrowed at Vaeros’s suggestion.  **“Dispose of, you mean restrain him?  I have some binds that might work.”**  He was a Jedi, if a weird one; certainly he couldn’t mean what she thought he had said. *Maybe Standard wasn’t his first language.* \n\nDel-Fin stated his intention to free Nadia, who was a Force user the rest of them could sense.  That sounded like a good plan, and fortunately lightsabers were also an excellent source of illumination.  The green and red blades cast clashing, bright beams.\n\nIyola turned to Varda as they set off. **“Varda, are you a Jedi too?”**",

The only known Mandalorian Jedi was ages ago, and had a legendary blade. Even then, upon his passing, Mandalorians stole his weapon to use as a self-insert as ruler. The way Wes fights isn\u0027t a traditional Jedi stance either; perhaps his master is a Bokken Jedi?*\n\nRegardless, Vaeros nods at the disarmament of the fallen man, **\"That works as well; if you use those binds, Iyola, it would be helpful; the sooner we move forward and access their ship, the sooner we can leave. These pirates, or whatever they are, seem to be here to enslave us, kill us, or worse. Nonetheless, we all seem to have unique properties in some way, and that\u0027s all the more reason we should avoid capture, if we make some assumptions based on the individual reaching out in the force.\"**\n\nVaeros glances over at Wes, then back at the group, **\"It seems that he already made up his mind.

For a tense second, everyone freezes, but the man\u0027s head just lolls to the side, and he sinks back into stillness.\n\nWith the immediate threat secured, Wes takes a decisive lead down the dark corridor of the ship, his green blade carving a path through the gloom. The choice is made for them. The rhythmic hiss of the emergency lights activating and deactivating ahead of him creates a strobing, urgent effect, pulling them deeper into the hostile ship. The air here is different—thicker, smelling of unidentifiable spilled fluids, stale nutrient paste, and the faint, coppery tang of fear.\n\nThe path forward splits. To the right, a narrower corridor likely leads towards the crew quarters and cockpit, the direction the terrified Twi\u0027lek fled. To the left, a wider, more industrial passage smelling of ozone and charged machinery leads towards the aft cargo bay, the direction the technician ran and where Wes\u0027s senses tell him the captive, Nadia, awaits.\n\nThe path to the aft cargo hold is short, but the sense of dread grows with every step. The emergency lights flicker more erratically here, casting the grimy walls in a chaotic dance of light and shadow. Ahead, the corridor opens into the dark expanse of the main cargo hold.",

Between the flickering lights and the green glow of his lightsaber there was an eerie feeling.  Several smells also filtered down from the aft leading corridor.   One’s he’d rather not know the origins from.  Overwhelmingly there was the sense of fear.  One that if it couldn’t be sensed in the Force the all knowing scent of it lingered heavily.  \n\n\n**”Split up or stay together?”**  He waited a moment for them to consider their action but it wasn’t more than a couple glances towards both paths.   **”There is also the other presence that’s trying to remain hidden heading up front.”**\n\n\nNot wanting to wait any longer he indicated the path aft.  He led the way with his lightsaber held defensively letting the blade effectively light the way.   The lighting was even more erratic.   It was as if the crew purposefully neglected this area of the ship.  The smells of captivity became stronger as did the smell of the fear.  He reached out once again with the force to this ‘Nadia’ that was being held.  ***’We are coming.’***  He sent his thoughts outward along with a calm presence through the force to the woman.   Those with him who could sense it could feel his calm presence and determination as he walked.  It combined with his appearance was something that the galaxy hadn’t seen in untold years.   A Force sensitive Mandalorian wielding a Jedi’s weapon.  \n\nHis eyes took in the corridor and his senses remained open as he walked into the opening of the dark cargo bay.",

It is a clean, orderly note in a symphony of static and fear. It feels ancient, structured, and humming with a cold, intellectual purity that is profoundly out of place on this grimy slaver vessel. It is the psychic equivalent of discovering a perfectly preserved, unopened manuscript lying in a filthy gutter.\n\nIt is the scent of *knowledge*, and to Vaeros, it is a lure far more potent than any plea for help or tactical advantage.
