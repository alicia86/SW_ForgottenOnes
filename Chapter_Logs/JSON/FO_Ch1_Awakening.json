The tyrannical GALACTIC EMPIRE tightens its grip, its vast war machine seeking to crush the last embers of freedom. Against this overwhelming might, a fledgling REBELLION fights a desperate shadow war, their hope dwindling with each passing day.\nBut this is not the first time the galaxy has been torn asunder. Across millennia, great powers have risen and fallen, their histories rewritten by the victors and their truths lost to time. Whispers persist of a hidden conflict fought not for territory, but for the soul of history itself.\nNow, in a forgotten corner of the Outer Rim, an ancient vessel, long thought lost, drifts silently. Aboard the ghost ship VENTURE, a cryptic emergency protocol has been triggered, awakening a handful of souls ripped from their own eras—survivors of conflicts long past, preserved for a purpose they do not understand, and about to be thrust into a war that is not their own….",

For a moment, Wes is adrift in a calm, cold void, a feeling of disconnection so complete it steals his breath. He instinctively reaches out with his senses, not his ears or eyes, but with the part of him that his master, Chase Davion, had helped him nurture. He feels the thrum of a distant power source, the cold metal of an enclosure, and a deep, oppressive stillness.\n\nThen, the physical world crashes in. The weakness in his limbs, the sluggish pound of his own heart, and the stale, musty air filling his lungs. He opens his eyes and finds only blackness, a disorienting void that his helmet\u0027s HUD should have instantly illuminated. The lack of his helmet is the first violation.\n\nHe is enclosed, his bare shoulders brushing against the smooth, curved wall of a tube. As he pushes himself up, his muscles scream in protest. A sharp, phantom pain pulls at his abdomen, an echo of a wound he can’t remember. A slow, methodical search confirms the final indignity: his armor, his blaster, his entire identity is gone. He is blind, weak, and stripped bare, left with nothing but a warrior\u0027s discipline and a connection to the Force that feels as broken and wrong as everything else.",

It feels like the worst hangover of his life, a nauseating wave of disorientation accompanied by a low hum that vibrates through the floor. His limbs are heavy, useless things, and a wracking cough echoes in the tight space he finds himself in. He tries to open his eyes, but the world remains a dizzying, pitch-black void.\n\nPanic, cold and sharp, begins to set in. He pushes out, his bare hands meeting the smooth, curved walls of some kind of tube. Where are his clothes? His coat? His blaster? His mind races, trying to pierce through a thick fog of memory. The last thing he remembers is a deal… a meeting… then nothing. He is blind, stripped of his gear, and trapped. For a man who has always relied on his wits and a quick escape, this is a nightmare realized.",

She opens her eyes to a void, but the physical darkness is less concerning than the one she feels within.\n\nHer senses, the ones beyond sight, extend tentatively. She reaches for the Force to see, but her second sight, once a source of clarity, is now a fractured lens, filled with static and echoes of pain. She feels the smooth, cold curve of an enclosure around her. A slow, aching movement confirms she has been stripped of her staff, her robes, everything. She is a seer without her focus, a witch without her talismans, left with nothing but the tainted power she carries inside her.",

A low, dissonant hum inside his own mind, the psychic static of a power source that has catastrophically overloaded. It is an infuriating echo. He opens his eyes to darkness, a simple physical problem that is secondary to the chaos in his own senses. He reaches out with the Force to perceive his surroundings, but his connection, usually a precise dueling blade, is now a fractured, unreliable torrent.\n\nThe weakness in his limbs is an indignity. The cold air is an impurity. He feels the smooth walls of his confinement and realizes with a surge of cold fury that he has been stripped bare. His uniform, his status, his lightsaber—all gone. He is not just a prisoner; he has been reduced to a mere specimen, an outcome his scholarly pride cannot bear.",

The shadows in her soul long chained, long buried rise like smoke in a windless room. The scar on her soul rises to meet it like an old friend. They revel and dance around each other like lost lovers.\n\n“We can fix you…”\n“Free you…”\n“Let you see farther than ever…”\n\nThe temptation is so close. Closer than it’s been in years. The dark speaks with a voice like velvet laced with poison, and her fingers twitch as if they might reach, might surrender. But then  A voice cuts through. Dry, tired and stern. “Varda, old friend. Really? Resorting to such measures already? Compartmentalise. Make a plan. You’re better than this.” Araden, the warrior chiding with the same annoyed fondness as always.\n\nThen another “The first rule of a diplomat,” Lyra’s voice lectures with crisp clarity, “is to never lose your head.”\n\nAnd softer still “Grandma? I thought you said… the darkness, the hate, was bad?” Lyrus. Her light. Her boy.\n\nThe final voice breaks her. So gentle, so intimate. “Varda, my love. Please… you know better. For all we worked for. Now is not when we break.”\n\nA tear slips down her cheek, and with it goes the crushing edge of panic. She chokes back a sob and forces herself to breathe. In, then out. Like it’s the last air she’ll ever taste. No. Not yet. Not ever.",

What was bothering him wasn’t just the silence, it was the absence of everything else.    He couldn’t feel the presence of the father and his two children.   The three of them were on the run.  Trying to not be discovered by the Empire.   The son, the younger of the two children, was Force sensitive.    He had been hired to take them to… he couldn\u0027t remember.  Immediately he was on alert.   The absence of the memory was concerning as there was no reason for it.  \n\n\n Keeping his calm he focused.   A combination of Mandalorian and Jedi training was bright to bear on the situation.  Cold metal and the thrum of some distant power source reverberated his surrounding area.  A stillness, oppressive in nature, wrapped him in a cocoon.  Similar to the metallic one he did not yet know existed.  \n\n\nLike a punch in the gut his other senses started registering.  No, it was more like they were protesting their current state.   His heart felt like it was just waking up and the air that exited his lungs smelled stale and tasted even worse.  Opening of his eyes held two revelations.  The darkness didn’t subside and his HUD didn’t activate with the movement of his eyes.  *Where’s my helmet?*  He thought as a small but growing tremor of unease ran through his body.",

It almost caused him to groan in pain but training kept him quiet.   For all he knew he was in danger.  Slowly and methodically he felt around and the realization of his current state hit home.   No armor and no weapons.  Whoever put him in this situation knew just how to strip him of his identity. \n\nAll he had was his mind and the Force and even that felt broken.   He placed his hands against the cold metal.   Despite the protest of the muscles in his arms, chest and back he pushed outward.   Unsure of what would happen next.",

The muscles in his arms and shoulders burn with an unnatural weakness, the stabbing pain in his abdomen flaring in protest. The wall doesn\u0027t budge. It feels solid, thick, like the hull of a starship.\n\nAs he pushes, his mind, sharpened by Mandalorian discipline, isolates the sounds within his prison. The thrum of the machinery is not uniform; it\u0027s a layered hum. There\u0027s a low, resonant drone that feels like the power source he first sensed, but beneath it, there is a fainter, higher-pitched whine—the sound of active cryo-circuitry, now in a standby or reanimation cycle.\n\nHis effort yields no escape. The metal remains cold, the darkness absolute, and the pain a constant, nagging reminder of his vulnerability. The silence outside his pod is unbroken.",

They had to be competent. No sloppy welds. No old-world rust. No charming panel held in place by hope and screws. Her captors had the audacity to be efficient.\n\nWith care and focus, she slips a thin thread of control outward, not a surge, but a probe, a tendril of her will uncoiling like a shadow across the polished interior. Her reach is cautious, quiet, tuned to the finer vibrations of structure and energy, like a whisper drawn through glass. It brushes the edges of the capsule.\n\nThe material is dense, layered. composite alloy reinforced with something she cannot name, but can feel. It hums with dormant energy, a low resonance designed to repel not just impact, but disruption. It isn’t simply meant to contain. It\u0027s meant to hold. \n\nShe lets her mind drift further, reaching beyond the interior shell, brushing along the pod’s exterior with quiet precision. Every movement is patient, methodical and desperate without showing it. Her probe glides along the smooth surface, searching for any irregularity: a seam, a fault, a crack in the cage’s immaculate design.\n\nThere has to be something. A hinge. A switch. A flaw. But there is nothing. No mechanical latch. No hidden clasp. No comforting clunk of machinery waiting to yield to a clever hand. The pod is maddeningly seamless, forged with an intent so clinical, so inhumanly perfect, it defies even her most honed instincts.\n\nStill, she presses on. Her will brushes over every inch it can touch, hunting for even the faintest protrusion, any node or raised surface her senses might interpret. Anything her mind can seize upon and twist open with effort or finesse.",

The constant, dissonant hum of his own fractured connection to the Force wars with the low thrum of the machinery, creating a cacophony of internal and external noise.\n\nHe pushes past it, casting his senses out not with finesse, but with raw, focused will. His perception slams against the walls of his prison. The material is, as he might have suspected, anathema to the Force—a dull, leaden weight in the cosmic flow, designed to insulate and contain.\n\nBut the *design*... that is something different. It is not the brutish efficiency of the Empire, nor the chaotic improvisation of the Outer Rim criminals he has hunted. The energy field sealing the pod is woven with a strange, almost biological harmony. The technology is ancient, impossibly so. It speaks of a philosophy of science he has only read about in the most forbidden of Jedi and Sith archives—a time when the Force was not just a power to be wielded, but a fundamental component of engineering.",

There is no reply.\n\nThe sharp sting in his eye from his own finger is a grounding, agonizing flash of reality, confirming the darkness is not a blindfold. The ringing from the impact of his head against the wall joins the pounding in his skull, a cacophony of misery.\n\nThe combination of panic, pain, and the futile physical effort is too much for his compromised system. A wave of acute nausea rolls through him, hot and swift. The acrid taste of bile rises in the back of his throat, and the world—the dark, featureless world inside his head—lurches violently.

A soft, sharp *hiss* from somewhere above her head, the sound of atmosphere equalizing.\n\nA hairline crack of pale, yellow light slices through the absolute darkness, momentarily blinding even her memory of sight. The crack widens as the entire front section of her pod retracts upwards into the ceiling, its movement utterly silent and smooth.\n\nThe stale air of her confinement is replaced by a rush of cold, sterile air that smells of ozone and chilled metal. The thrumming of machinery is louder now, more layered. And with the front of her prison gone, she can hear the faint, rhythmic hiss of other, similar machines nearby.\n\nThe world has opened up, but her eyes have not.

The air is sterile, sharp with the scent of ozone.\n\nThey are five strangers, isolated by their individual blindness but now united by proximity. Weakness is a universal language; every limb feels like it\u0027s made of lead, every breath is a conscious effort, and a deep, cellular cold clings to them. For the Force-sensitives, the room is a cacophony of pain and confusion— the fractured echo of their own damaged spirits, and the unsettling hum of the technology that surrounds them.\n\nThe silence between the machinery\u0027s hum is punctuated by the ragged cough of one, the shuddering breath of another. They are adrift in the same boat, blind, weak, and utterly vulnerable. The question, unspoken but hanging heavy in the cold air, is who will be the first to break the silence and discover they are no longer alone.",

No matter how hard he pushed nothing moved and all it did was to make already sore and screaming muscles even more irritable.  \n\nRealizing that using brute force was futile he sank back into his coffin.  *’This isn’t good.’*  He thought to himself.   No sooner had the thought finished a loud *hiss* cut through the silence causing him to startle as the seals released.   Different air rushed in.   He wouldn’t have said it was better as it was cold, recycled and smelled of ozone.  \n\n\nIt was then he felt the others and the sounds of other containers making the same drawn out hissing sounds as his container did.  He drew his Force presence in and laid still for a few seconds as his hand did what it could to cut down the sharp pain of the now intense lighting that stung his eyes.  His limbs felt heavy as he tried to move them.   As he bent his arms and legs he imagined a cracking noise as they moved. When he bent at the waist the pain in his abdomen shot through him causing him his head to spin.  \n\n\nIt didn’t take long for the silence to be broken.  What sounded like a body hitting the floor sounded out.  It was followed by a male voice swearing.  Wes noted the sound of the voice and where it was.   He already had an idea where the humanoid Was.  He wasn’t very focused but he could sense the position of the body off to his left crumpled on the floor.   \n\n\nHe took a deeper breath to talk and the effort was rewarded with a wracking cough as his lungs struggled to cope with the deep breath.   He started to talk but ended up coughing again.  Finally when he was able to take a small bit deeper breath he was able to find his voice.   **”It might be better to wait a moment before moving.”**  He said as loud as he dared not knowing who else was there or listening.  \n\n\nHe didn’t listen to his own advice as he continued to move his limbs attempting to move him to a seated position.",

She lets out her breath, a loud, shuddering gasp.\n\nThen she hears it - voices, movement.  Someone curses, a male voice.  Another voice cautions - a deep, low voice, another man, perhaps - that they shouldn’t move. \n\nIyola needs to move.  She crawls forward towards the nearest voice, the first one. Her hands span out, feeling the floor before her for drops or holes.  The metal floor is harsh on her bare knees.\n\n**“Hey, hi, are you OK?

The pod hisses open behind her, and she steps out into the stale, recycled air of a world she does not know. Her feet hit metal, too slick, too cold and a spike of vertigo shoots through her. She clutches her head as sound crashes into her all at once. Raised voices. Footsteps. The sharp shouts of fear. Chaos with the cadence of panic.\n\nShe sighs, rubbing her temple with a grimace. “**By the spirits... we all have the same headache,**” she mutters. “**Yet you’re all still screaming.**” Her voice is hoarse, dry as dust. It doesn’t matter. No one’s listening.\n\nShe reaches out, steadying herself against the nearby wall. Her knees threaten rebellion, and a wave of nausea rises like a tide to drown her. *So that’s how it’s going to be, *she thinks. Worse still, her cane is gone. The absence of its weight throws her balance further, like a limb missing, like a spell half-cast. The world tilts. Her breath comes measured, slow and shallow. She narrows her focus, tucking the pain into a quiet corner of her mind.\n\nAnd then, through the din, she listens. One voice then another and another still. Four, she counts. Distinct, though overlapping. All harried, all reacting. She files their tones, pacing, and rhythms into mental boxes. Names can come later.  For the moment she keeps to herself. waiting to see how the thread unravels.",

Her throat is parched, and she instinctively reaches for her canteen, only to brush her fingers against the bare side of her torso.  \n\nSudden a new ship, robotic, like a ship announcement.

She draws the Force to her not in desperation, but with the deliberate grace of an old ritual. Her breath slows.\n\nThe battlefield calm. The silence of a mind balanced on the edge of the blade. That space where instinct and clarity become one. She sinks into it. Feels it take hold. Then, gently, she pushes it outward, Not as a command nor a shove. But a touch a wave of stillness unfurling through the room like warm mist. She threads it through the air, quiet and careful an offer, not an imposition. Like a hand extended, or the hush of an old lullaby. Like a knock at a door asking to be let in. Something that says: You are not alone. You are not in danger. Breathe.\n\nShe lets the wave pulse outwards and raises her voice slightly. \"**Peace companions. In this state we can\u0027t afford to be bubbling around the room like a pack of drunk rancours. We appear to not be in immediate harm. Let us all be calm. No one in this room means to cause pain.**\"",

Vaeros thinks,*She must be strong in the force to overcome this; the calming effect is minuscule, but nice. Wait, is that Jedi speech? Is that why it\u0027s so calming?

They could be helpful in finding her jacket. * She’s not leaving without it.  Another man suggests they go toward the portal, and that seems like as good idea as any.\n\nShe feels the movement in the stale air as the formerly panicking man crawls forward, and she steps to the side, hopefully out of his path. \n\nThen the voice emerged.  Eve.  Some kind of super-powered droid. *What the kriff was the Venture?  And how did she and the rest of them get here? *\n\n**“Eve,**” she asks, **“you said you woke us up.

Immediately he thought of Marina.  How long has it been?  Almost as quickly as the thought of her entered his mind he tucked it away.  It was something he’d have to look into when their fat wasn’t in the fire.   \n\n\nIt was then he felt it.  As the old woman spoke he felt the subtle waves and her presence in the Force.  Now knowing where she was he looked directly in her direction.   His eyesight was still void of any details but the lower illumination no longer scalded his limited vision.  Instead of what looked like a bright sun he could now make out a fuzz that was more vague than anything else.  The calming presence shifted his mindset as he started looking around.  \n\n\nThe earlier angry male voice spoke again.  He was calmer this time.  His suggestion of moving towards the light seems to make sense.  He nodded but didn’t say anything as he slowly moved towards what seemed like the only light in his hazy vision",

Apparently it would help with the hibernation after effects and it sounded like they were going to need it.  Five unfriendlies were trying to board them.  And from the earlier info Eve had given them the five of them were the only ones on board.

I think it\u0027s relevant to this situation; my name\u0027s Vaeros.\"** As he speaks, he cringes at the thought of forming connections in this situation, but it should ideally keep a minimum, positive relationship; just enough for the group to hopefully dissuade turning on each other if we make it. \n\nWaiting for their response, he stands idle, waiting for the group to move.",

The sluggishness vanishes, replaced by a jittery, high-octane energy.\n\nBut the most profound change is his sight. The fuzzy, indistinct darkness that has plagued him shatters into a million points of light, which then coalesce with painful clarity. For the first time since waking, he truly *sees*.\n\nHe sees the sterile, metallic cryo-bay they\u0027ve just left, the five open pods recessed into the walls. He sees the others: all of them in various states of undress. The old woman he has taken by the arm, her white hair braided, her expression grim but steady; the angry-sounding man, Vaeros, holding his own injector, his posture taut and suspicious; the younger woman, looking around with a mix of awe and anxiety; and the one who had panicked, still on the floor but now pushing himself up, his eyes wide with a different kind of shock.\n\nThe antechamber before them is short, leading to another heavy, sealed door. Along the walls of this small room are five recessed equipment lockers, each with a small, unlit biometric panel next to it. They are marked with simple, numeric designations: 01, 02, 03, 04, and 05.

She pulls out the cloak first dark and worn, wrapping her in the comfort of identity. The fabric settles, hiding the tremble in her limbs. Then come the pouches small, precise tools of her trade. She ties them to her belt with deft fingers, each knot anchoring her more firmly in the present.\n\nFinally, she reaches for it. The cane, though it\u0027s more a staff, really. Crafted from dark grey and rich brown wood, its surface is etched with carvings that dance beneath her fingertips: storms in full fury, clouds roiling with motion, lightning split like rivers, and through them, owls, wings spread wide, flying between the chaos. Wisdom threading the storm.\n\nEvenly spaced along the staff are three rings of polished beskar, A metal with a dull gleam in the light. Each one is etched with the same intricate runes and sigils that mark her own skin. a harmony of metal, wood, and self.\n\nShe draws it free with both hands, holding it reverently, as if greeting an old friend. Relief flickers across her features she takes a slow breath. She leans on it, finally having her anchor once again. Then, with quiet deliberation, she taps the cane against the floor. Once. Twice. Thrice. Each tap releases a hum, low and resonant, like a tuning fork struck by time itself. The beskar rings sing in harmony, a layered chord of storm and steel.\n\nShe turns to Iyola. a small twinge at the side of her mouth, the crows feet deepen as she regards her. \"**Ahh, why thank you. They were a right of passage. It\u0027s been so long now I sometimes forget they\u0027re there**\" She lets out a small chuckle.",

The vacuum-sealed doors retract smoothly, revealing the familiar shapes of their personal gear, meticulously cleaned and arranged. The sight of their armor, their weapons, their *identity* waiting for them is a moment of profound relief in the sterile, hostile environment.\n\nEverything is there: the worn leather of a field jacket, the intimidating gleam of Mandalorian iron, the familiar weight of a favored blaster pistol. It feels like coming home.\n\nBut as they take inventory, a subtle and unsettling wrongness becomes apparent. Any datachips or datapads they owned are present, but their memory has been wiped clean, formatted to a factory default. Any holocrons, those precious repositories of unique knowledge, are simply gone.\n\nAnd their credits, the universal currency of the galaxy, have been replaced. In their place non-descript synth-leather pouch. Inside, a small collection of cut gemstones—lustrous sapphires, fiery opals, deep green emeralds—clinks softly together. They are clearly valuable, but their origin and purpose are a complete mystery. Someone, or something, has not only preserved their gear but has also curated it, removing all personal data and liquid assets, replacing them with untraceable, anonymous wealth.",

Now that he can see the group, he looks over at Iyola with an inquisitive smile, once she has introduced herself. **\"I\u0027m Vaeros, Iyola.\"**\n\nFalling back to the task at hand, Vaeros rubs the scar running along his left cheekbone as he watches the other individuals go to their glowing locker. He decides to follow along, and he looks for his locker. \n\nReaching his respective locker, it glows, clicking open as the locks disengage. He first dresses in his black vacuum suit, with Imperial insignia on both upper arms, then wears a black robe and pants over it. Once his clothes are on, he fastens his cortosis gauntlets on his forearms, a wrist-mounted commlink,  a utility belt around his waist, and attaches an inquisitor\u0027s mask to it. Once it\u0027s in place, he triggers the vacuum seal on his suit and turns on his commlink, with a chirp indicating its operation.\n\nReaching into the locker again, he realizes something is critically missing: his holocron, his prized possession granted to him during the Clone Wars under Dooku\u0027s group of Dark Acolytes. His data pad and credit chips work, but they are missing his notes, maps, and banking information. In place of it is a pouch of luxury jewels. He takes the pouches of jewels and attaches them to his belt.",

With a cursory glance he looked inside.   It all appeared to be there.  His Beskar\u0027gam and blaster were prominent as well as his other gear.   \n\n\nTaking a breath he reached for the black body suit he wore beneath the armor.  It pulled on easily which only spurred him on faster.   Boots went on next followed by his leg armor.  Each piece was placed and attached with a practiced efficiency that only came from years of repetition.   As he let the chest and back plates settle onto his shoulders it became obvious as to what he was.   Mandalorian.  A familiar metallic sound from something Varda tapped against the deck plating caught his attention.  It was the sound of Beskar.   He spotted her cane and the three pieces of Beskar that adorned it.   He raised an eyebrow wondering but knowing that this wasn’t the time.  \n\n\nBeyond her he saw Vaeros attach a lightsaber hilt and an inquisitor mask to his utility belt.  He stood up quickly looking at the man.  Taking note of his appearance.   He took a deep breath as he fought to keep control of his emotions and his Force presence in close as to not give himself away to the enemy.   The one he’d been on the run from for over a decade.  His eyes spoke what words didn’t.   And he knew it would have to wait.   *’The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  For now.’*  He thought as he reached for his bucket and pulled it on over his head.   His blaster and utility belt were next. As he looked them both over before adding the rest of his armor.  He looked over his arm vambraces and nodded satisfied that all was in order.  That his lightsaber was still hidden within the right vambrace.    \n\n\nHe stood almost two meters tall now.   His hand resting on the grip of his blaster pistol.   The HUD in his helmet giving him information on his surroundings.",

It must have meaning to you….  Did you make it?”** She peeked at the runes on it to see if she recognized any of them.\n\nFinding her own locker, Iyola gratefully grabbed her gear, pulling on her pants, boots, belt, and harness, strapping on her ascension gun, and, of course, her beloved turquoise-green synthleather jacket. \n\nA younger blond man was dressing himself in a very impressive dark-hued ensemble - black cape, metal bracers, with some kind of gear-like symbol that Iyola didn’t recognize immediately. *It would likely come to her soon enough. *\n\nHe introduced himself as Vaeros. Iyola smiled back with one of her sunniest smiles.  He was pretty cute. She couldn’t help but notice the lightsaber on his belt.  **“Hi Vaeros, it’s good to meet you**,” Iyola said  **“Glad to have a Jedi with us in this kind of situation. And, I’m sure, other situations too.” **\n\nThe tall, muscular man - this one must be Del-Fin, then - was dressing himself with great care in metal armor.  Looked like the traditional costumes she’d seen  in Keldabe, on the outer rim planet of Mandalore.  It was interesting to see the complete kit in action.  \n \nThe scruffy, dark-haired man looked a lot happier after the drug injection.  He was wearing absurd red goggles. *He looked like he’d be a lot of fun, or trouble, or both.  * Dryzan - that was his name - asked them all if they were ready to kark things up.  Iyola laughed a bit, which felt good.** “I mean, not on purpose, but maybe” she replied.**",

Vaeros, now clad in the severe black of his old life, carries an air of cold analysis, while Iyola\u0027s natural curiosity and bright energy begin to reassert themselves.\n\nVarda stands a little apart, the ancient wood of her staff a grounding presence in her hands. The runes are unfamiliar to Iyola\u0027s eyes, their patterns ancient and alien, unlike any script she\u0027s seen in Republic or even Outer Rim archives. They seem less like writing and more like a map of natural forces—the flow of wind, the crack of lightning, the spiral of a galaxy.\n\nAs the last piece of armor is buckled and the last weapon holstered, the sterile silence is broken by a chime. On the wall behind them, a large holographic display flickers to life, drawing their attention.",

She studies each of them with a silent, appraising eye. \n\nHer thoughts drift like smoke, but she anchors them with a smile as Iyola admires her staff. “**Aye, I did,**” Varda replies, pride softening her features. “**It took many weeks of carving, of long, patient work. But I’ve no regrets. The storm teaches patience, and in the end, I’m content with what it’s become.”**” Her fingers brush the storm-carved wood as she speaks, and then, without hesitation, her eyes flit to Iyola’s attire. “**That jacket of yours is finely cut, dear. The colour suits you well, it catches the light like water across stone. Makes your complexion glow**”\n\nShe turns as Vaeros speaks, Varda gives a small nod of agreement at the suggestion of comlinks. She moves with quiet steps walking forward and offering each of them her personal signal in turn. Then, with a smooth motion, she places her own in the crook of her ear. The small device hums faintly as it activates. \n\nBusiness handled, her gaze drifts toward the projection. the image of the intruders. Her expression shifts. A deep line creases her brow. Her lips press thin. She wonders *Why this ship? if from what I\u0027ve seen we\u0027re a handful of nobodies locked in stasis. What reason do they have to board?*",

That feeling you get when you return to a familiar place, only to find the walls repainted and the floorboards slightly out of place. The bones of it remain, but the soul has shifted.... She sees it then, not with her eyes, but with the deep sense that has guided her longer than either of them have likely lived.\n\n*How strange...There’s something in the way they hold themselves. Not the set of shoulders or the stance of their feet, but in the Force. Their presences are tight, drawn inwards like silk thread pulled taut. Woven too fine like they\u0027re shielded or...or they’re hiding?* she realises.\n\nShe remembers the younger sisters, long ago those first initiates who trembled through their meditations, uncertain and raw. When fear gripped them, they would coil inward, stifle their light, as if to keep the galaxy from hearing them breathe. *Perhaps,* she wonders. *These two never had the guided hand of a stable teacher. Or worse, perhaps they were taught by someone who believed fear was strength, or silence was safety.*",

We did not clutch it to our chests like secrets waiting to be stolen.*\n\nAs the others begin to prepare, checking weapons, adjusting gear, sharpening focus. She reaches outward, with a series of soft, playful tendrils. Thin wisps of her presence spun like threads of silk into the current of the Force. She touches Vaeros first. Just a brush. Like tapping the surface of still water with the edge of her thought. *Why so taught?* Then Del-fin, with a gentler nudge. A coaxing flicker. *Are you there?*\n\nShe prods here, tugs there, spins her presence around them like an eager puppy. It’s the same game she used to play with the younger sisters in the halls of Ichor. teasing, almost, but always with purpose. *Come on, her presence whispers, light and wry. Just a little spark. Let me see how you shine.* It\u0027s been many years since she encountered another force user. But to see them so confined makes her rage on the inside. It makes her want to see them truly be free",

His speech reminds her of the administrators and professors in her family, and his bow is formal.  She wonders where he’s from.  *Maybe Chandrilla?*  His suggestion to share the comlink signals is a good one.\n\nIyola pulls out her comlink from one of her multiple pockets. Instinctively, she flips to Caz’s code - maybe there’s time to send him a quick all-clear-  *it’s blank*.  She stares at the com for a click, then cycles through the other codes.  *Mom, Dad - sisters, friends, they’re all gone. * She draws a quick, sharp breath, and her hand shakes a bit.\n\nShe swallows hard.  She has contingency plans.  She’ll deal with this later. She shares her comlink information with the others, and then *she’s got to do something*.\n\n**“Hey, Eve, can you download the schematic to my datapad and mark the fastest route?” ** She turns to the others.  **“We can get to the inner door before they enter if we’re fast enough, but we’ve got to go now.” **",

Not fully, not to the point of retreat but enough to give them space.  “**Apologies,**” she says softly to Del-fin, her voice low and even. “**I was... concerned.**”. She looks sharply at Vaeros for a moment before pulling back even more. Not meaning to pry into his past. She looks apologetic and slightly affeered before it\u0027s all wiped from her face and she steps forward to the group. allowing herself to be motioned where people think she best fits.",

He knew she wasn’t trying to pry but this was just a bad time and the fact that an inquisitor was present made it that much more so.    \n\n\nWhen the schematic came up Wes tapped his bracer computer and sent the image to the HUD in his helmet.   The path looked pretty straightforward and with Eve locking all other doors it should be even easier.  **”Lets not wait.”** He stopped talking as soon as Vaeros’s lightsaber found its way to his hand.   Instinctively his hand went to his blaster.  The pause lasted for a second.  **”Close combatants take positions that work for them.   Ranged, do the same.   We can guess their intentions and have a good idea.  Let’s go find out what our uninvited guests really want.”**  He moved out with the head on a smooth swivel as they moved.",

The air here is colder, the silence deeper. It is a ghost ship, a place of long-dormant machinery and forgotten purpose.\n\nAs they step forward, the section of the corridor immediately ahead of them flickers to life. Dim, white emergency lights embedded in the floor and ceiling cast long, distorted shadows, giving the hallway an eerie, spectral glow. The metal walls seem to absorb the light, making the space feel both illuminated and deeply shadowed at the same time.\n\nThey press on, a strange collection of figures moving through the silent ship—a hulking Mandalorian, a robed Inquisitor, a wiry scoundrel, a brightly-clad scout, and an old woman leaning on an ancient staff. As they pass the midway point of the lit section, the lights behind them extinguish, plunging the path they\u0027ve just walked back into absolute darkness. Simultaneously, the next section of the corridor ahead illuminates, beckoning them forward.\n\nHeavy bulkhead doors block their path at intervals. As they approach, each door slides open with a whisper of hydraulics, revealing another identical, dimly lit section of corridor, only to hiss shut again once the last person has passed through, leaving them with the unsettling feeling of being drawn deeper into the ship\u0027s heart, with no easy way back. The only sound is the soft scuff of their boots on the deck plating and their own measured breathing.",
