He unslings the old satchel he recovered from the *Devastation*. He sets the recovered holodiscs on his desk, but his attention is on the true prize. He lifts the fractured, six-faced purple cube from the bag.\n\nIt is cold to the touch, its cracked surface absorbing the light in the room. He places it on the desk and reaches out with the Force.\n\nThe Holocron hums to life. Light spills from the fractured seam, but it is not the pure, angry red of a Sith holocron, nor the calm blue of the Jedi. It is a chaotic, mesmerizing dance between the two—a swirling nebula of violet, crimson, and azure contained within the crystal lattice. Whispers fill the room, ancient and layered. Not one voice, but dozens. Fragments of Sith alchemy, axioms of forgotten Jedi Force techniques, star-charts pointing to worlds that no longer exist, and philosophical questions that have no easy answers.\n\nThe Holocron is not a single key, but a thousand broken locks. It is the legacy of Dooku's heresy, the proof of a Third Path.\n\nVaeros stands in the swirling light, the logs delivered, his duty to the Empire fulfilled for now. But in his hands, he holds a new, far more dangerous secret. He has lost a loyal guardian but gained a library of forbidden knowledge. The path of the Inquisitor feels smaller than ever before, and the ghost of the *Devastation* has shown him a new, uncertain horizon. What he does next will be his choice alone.\n\n***The End***","timestamp":"2025-07-01T00:18:28.732000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"❤️"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"webhook_id":"1382501818768298095","type":0,"application_id":"644942473315090434","flags":0,"components":[],"position":234,"userName":"Storyteller"},{"id":"1389399589651484764","channel_id":"1385685912834277456","author":{"id":"1382501818768298095","username":"Grand Inquisitor","avatar":"52a6bf0a537160599722aaef0e8d0af5","discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"bot":true,"global_name":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"**\"The mission is complete.

Vaeros nods, shaking off the self-pity. He and R3 turn back to the task. The final piece of the puzzle is the energy transfer coil, fused solid. This requires a touch far more delicate than a cutting torch.\n\nVaeros selects a harmonic resonator from the tool kit, a slender rod designed to vibrate at precise frequencies. He carefully applies it to the fused seam, sending microscopic vibrations into the metal. At the same time, R3 extends a pair of micro-grippers, applying steady, precise counter-pressure on the coil itself. It’s a delicate, zero-gravity dance of opposing forces. For a long, tense minute, nothing happens. Then, with a barely audible *ping*, the fused metal gives way. A hairline fracture appears, then widens as Vaeros adjusts the frequency.\n\nWith a final, satisfying *click*, the coil separates from its housing, clean and whole.\n\nVaeros works quickly now, slotting the coil back into its proper place and rerouting the power conduits with R3's help. He makes the final connection. For a second, there is only silence. Then, a deep, powerful hum resonates through the entire ship, a feeling of immense, controlled energy that replaces the death rattle of moments before. On the main console, the `HYPERDRIVE OFFLINE` error message flickers, and turns to a steady, operational green.\n\nThe heart of the Reaper beats once more.","timestamp":"2025-06-29T18:24:17.822000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"webhook_id":"1382501818768298095","type":0,"application_id":"644942473315090434","flags":0,"components":[],"position":225,"userName":"Storyteller"},{"id":"1388948205311627407","channel_id":"1385685912834277456","author":{"id":"1382501818768298095","username":"R3-K4","avatar":"ef1a544fd249ea30ccae6fa08758887e","discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"bot":true,"global_name":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"A sharp, insistent chirp cuts through the gloom.

The main viewscreen is a fractured nightmare of transparisteel, showing the violent, silent dance of the nebula outside.

The air is thick with the acrid smoke of heavy blaster fire.\n\nIn the center of the sunken command pit, **15 squares** directly in front of Vaeros, a **Droideka (DK1)** has deployed. Its bronze armor plating is scorched, but its personal energy shield shimmers with malevolent power. Its twin blaster cannons are glowing cherry-red as they lay down a relentless field of fire.\n\nFurther back and to the right, nestled between the main viewscreen and a bank of burning terminals, is the second **Droideka (DK2)**. It is **25 squares** away from Vearos’s position and has a commanding field of fire over the entire room. Its shield is also active, and its cannons are focused on the far side of the bridge.\n\nTo the left, **12 squares** from Varos, **Karnyx** is crouched behind a barricade of overturned computer stations. He leans out, fires a disciplined shot from his E-5 rifle at DK2, and ducks back as a torrent of answering fire splashes against his cover.\n\nIn the command pit, only **18 squares** from Varos but dangerously close to DK1, **R3-K4** is tucked behind the master command console.

Alarms flash across the console as Vaeros fights the ship, his experience evident in the precise, economical movements of the control yoke. He skillfully weaves through a field of crystalline debris, the shards scraping against the hull like angry claws.\n\nFor a moment, it seems his skill will be enough. But the nebula is treacherous.
