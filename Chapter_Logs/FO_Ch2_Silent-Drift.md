***A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....***

### **STAR WARS**
#### **FORGOTTEN ONES**
##### **Episode II: Silent Drift**

Consciousness returns not with a jolt, but as a slow, gentle tide. The eight hours of forced, dreamless sleep have been a balm. The leaden weight in their limbs is gone, replaced by a manageable ache, the phantom pains of muscles remembering how to live.

Most remarkably, when they open their eyes, the darkness is gone. The soft, ambient light of the barracks is clear and steady. The blindness, the most terrifying aspect of their awakening, has passed, leaving behind only the memory of its suffocating presence.

A new sensation, or rather the lack of one, slowly registers. The deep, resonant hum of the hyperdrive that has been the constant, underlying note of their existence since leaving the *Aether* is gone. The ship is no longer rushing through a river of light. It is adrift.

A chime, soft and clear, echoes through the barracks' internal speakers, followed by Eve's calm, synthesized voice.

From a viewport, the view is spectacular and serene. Outside, a vast, incandescent sphere of white-gold fire—the system's G-type star—hangs in the blackness, its corona a shimmering halo. The ship's immense, wing-like solar collectors, previously folded against the hull, are now fully deployed, their dark, crystalline surfaces drinking in the raw energy of the star.

**"The solar collectors are operating at optimal efficiency. Recharging the primary power cells from their current critical state to minimum operational levels will require approximately twelve standard hours. I recommend you use this time to rest and take nourishment."**

Entering what he now claimed as his quarters Wes slowly walked to the bunk after locking the door.  He didn’t even bother removing his Beskar’gam as he could already feel the weariness begin to overcome him.  Besides, sleeping in his armor was second nature to Mandalorian’s.  Removing his helmet he let it fall unceremoniously to the floor by the bunk.   As he sat back on the bunk he asked Eve a question.   It was *the* question that had been on his mind since he had awoken in the Medbay.  


**”Eve I’m guessing that you have some extensive data banks on the galaxy's history.   Hopefully over the last twenty years.”**  He laid back on to the bunk as his weariness grew more oppressive.  Eve had responded back with an affirmative to his question.    **”Good.   Please look for the name Marina Cloudspinner.   Jedi Padawan assigned to Master Silas Draay.  Find any info you can on her and send it to my bracer computer.  Thanks. He took a deep breath as his vision darkened and he felt the redoubled effects of the cryo sleep descend upon him.   He did his best to fall into a Force trance that would allow him to heal quicker.  His body once again felt tired and used as he laid there.  Sleep, if what was claiming him, hit him hard.   


The next thing he remembered was Eve’s voice telling him that they had arrived at the system and recharging operations had begun.  Opening his eyes he discovered that his vision had returned.   With a slow and stiff effort his muscles all protested being asked to function in such a mundane effort as sitting.    He wondered what would happen if he asked more of his body right now.  Despite the aches and pains of movement he stood and attempted to stretch some of the stiffness and painful discomfort away.

He looked at his bracer computer and saw no message from Eve about Nadia. **”Eve status report on Nadia.  When will her cycle in the medical unit be completed?”**  As he spoke a more important matter arose as his stomach made a terrible sounding noise.  The need for food suddenly appeared.  **”Also you just mentioned food.   Where is it?”**

*1401181708438601891*

Varda wakes slowly conscious comming to her first in the sound of the hum of the ship, dreams of stars and darkness. Of winged things and fanged things fading away in a blur of starlight. Faces of people she knows. May know or perhaps was once fated to know but now  fated to travel a different path flow like the currents of a river. words spoken to her in mandalorian from her old friends coil close to her heart. Old dathomiri chants wind down her spine. Bringing forth in her dreams arcs of lighting. But as all things do they all fade to black and Varda slowly sits up. 

She begins to gather pouches and sashes. Forming her outfit. She unties her hair letting it flow down to her back in rivers of silver. she grasps her cane letting the strange warmth of shadowed sunlight and static od a storm yet to brake mesh and move with her own presence. She sits letting the last vestige of sleep finally fade.  Then with a sigh and a weary smile to herself at letting gravity torture some more she stands with her bones creaking. coughing slightly as the dryness of her throat she startles as she realises she has missed too many cups of tea in her absence. She walks slowly enjoying the veiw of the ship and taking the time to look at the blazing sun. Following the lights of what she hopes is the kitchen she meanders her way through. 

Reaching it she takes a moment to untie a certain knot in her bag and with a twitch of the force she floats out a menagerie of tea cups and a strange tea pot.

Each tea cup settles itself in a small square. The first to hit the table is small thing perhaps only good for one or two sips. its shaped with black clay but spread throughout it is a soft warmth of orange. inlaid into the rim of the cup in fancy filigree 'My heart'. The next is a cup made of a silver ceramic more geometric with sharp lines and hard edges. The small image of an owl printed on the side. the third is a cup that she places in front of herself. Lare and carved from a dark wood. the outside full to the brim of small runes painted in a light purple. The final cup is circular made of a pale white no personality. just a pale white cup. The teapot itself is made of a crystal. Crudely shaped and but done with love. She sets each out filling the tea pot with water and sprinkling her own herbs inside. She sets the water to boil then takes a seat herself letting the sound of the flame bring her comfort.

Wes's bracer computer chimes softly, displaying a new message from Eve. The subject line reads: `DATA REQUEST: CLOUDSPINNER, MARINA`. The contents are a dense but well-organized data packet. It contains a standard Jedi Order public file on Padawan Marina Cloudspinner, her masters, her known lineage, and her notable service record during the Clone Wars. The file is comprehensive... up to a point. All official records abruptly cease in the year 19 BBY. There is nothing further.

Eve's synthesized voice answers his spoken query through a small speaker in his quarters.

**"The eight-hour regenerative stasis cycle for the subject Nadia is complete. She is stabilized. I have held her in a suspended state. You may initiate the revival sequence at any time. However, continued stasis would allow for more complete recovery from the long-term effects of her malnutrition and physical trauma. The decision is yours.”
There's a pause as she switches tracks to his next question: “The galley is located three sections forward, port-side."** Pathing lights illuminate along the wall to show Wes the way.

Varda's slow, meandering path through the silent, flickering corridors leads her to a wider, more utilitarian space. The galley is a surprise. While the tables are simple metal bolted to the floor and the nutrient dispensers hum with bland efficiency, the entire port-side wall is a single, massive viewport, currently showing a breathtaking, unfiltered view of the Kinooine sun—a colossal sphere of white-gold fire hanging in the blackness. The ship's immense, wing-like solar collectors are visible, their dark surfaces drinking in the raw energy. Next to the viewport is a simple control panel, clearly designed to adjust the filtration levels, allowing one to dim the star's brilliant glare to a comfortable, ambient glow. It is a room designed for quiet contemplation as much as for sustenance.

She turns to face the large bay window with a small smile. Always in awe of the vastness of the universe. She takes the moment to take the pot of boil. Then pours herself a cup. she moves to stand in front of the large window and takes a moment to merely watch

*1401206086937088132*

The chime on his bracer computer caught his attention.  Bringing up the screen he read the header of the file.  It was the info he had requested about Marina before he passed out.  It was a standard file.  Nothing he didn’t already know from the time they spent together.  As expected the timeline ended at the time of Order 66.   There was no mention of or update of being killed.  While it wasn’t much of a consolation it was a small something.   


Eve’s response to Nadia was favorable.  Her recommendation of letting her stay in continued stasis was advisable.  He nodded even though the AI wasn’t appearing on the room screen.   **”Undersrood.  Keep her there in recovery mode or whatever it is.   Do you have a guess on how much longer she may need on that recovery?”**  


He didn’t wait for her response as he reached for his helmet that he dropped on the floor next to the bunk and headed out the door for the galley.  The emptiness of his stomach was unlike anything he had felt before.   


The movement of his body felt good.  Tired and weary muscles stretched and loosened with every step.  As he walked he thought once again about Nadia and the familiar sense he felt.   How she looked at his clan sigil almost as if she was in disbelief of her own eyes.   He still couldn’t place her face or name.  Not recognizing her face wasn’t a surprise.   Judging from her age she seemed to be late teens or early twenties.  If he had seen her before she would have still been a young child.   As for her name it didn’t ring a bell.

His thoughts carried him to the sterile door of the galley.  Stepping closer it opened for him and his senses were greeted with the aromatic smell of something perhaps brewed.  Which if he remembered there was only water and nutrient paste for consumption.   **”It’s not caf but whatever it is, it smells good.”**  He said aloud as he entered the galley.   Looking around he caught the outside view and Varda standing there with a steaming cup of liquid in her hands.   He gave her a nod as he headed for the nutrient paste dispensers.

**"The initial eight-hour protocol has concluded. All foreign chemical agents have been purged from the subject's system, hydration and baseline nutritional values have been restored, and critical tissue damage has been stabilized. She is no longer in immediate physiological danger."**

The AI's voice follows him as he walks the silent, now steadily lit corridors. **"Continued regenerative stasis will now focus on mitigating the long-term effects of chronic malnutrition and muscle atrophy. Based on her current metabolic markers, I project a minimum of six to eight additional hours for optimal cellular regeneration. However, I must note a potential adverse outcome. A rapid and complete physical recovery, without a corresponding period for psychological acclimatization, may create a significant cognitive and emotional dissonance for the subject upon reanimation. A slower, more gradual healing process often allows the mind to process trauma in parallel with the body's recovery. The decision remains yours."**

***BEFORE ENTERING THE GALLEY***

**”Undersrood Eve.   Wake her up in say ninety minutes.   That way she’s not as compromised as she would be right now and her mind and body will still have time to process the rest of the healing together.  Give me a heads up when the clock runs out and start the wake up process after you do.   I want to be there when she wakes up.  Thank you Eve.”**

She turns as Wes enters. As he speaks a flash of sorrow builds between her eyes before it records. "**Hmm, I'm afraid ill have to disagree. Nothing can beat a good of cup tea, mind you it has to be the right blend of course.**" 

she waves her hand the other three cups stacking neatly before they fall into her bag. "**I'm afraid those cups are more ceremonial. There should be some round here here I presume.**" She gives him a light smile and goes back to watching the burning star.

Vaeros yawns, gradually waking up, but subconsciously, he grabs a canteen from his nearby utility belt and takes a sip. Feeling refreshed, he grabs his attire and belts, walking towards a nearby refresher, but something clicks. **"Oh, wait, I'm not in my usual quarters, am I?"**  he murmurs, shrugging.

After washing up and dressing, he stretches, settling into a comfortable position within the barracks. He sits, placing his lightsaber in front of him and entering a crisscross position, balling his fists and setting them on an adjacent knee; it's a daily meditation technique used to engage his mind for routine warmups.

Once done, he exits the room and walks toward the galley to get breakfast. He nods at those within the galley before walking towards the paste dispenser, but does not think much of those in the galley. Walking to a dispenser, he fills a bowl, then moves towards an isolated table to eat.

Wes smiled as Varda commented on the tea. **”I don’t know, tea was never really my thing but any port in the storm or so they say.”**  He made for the paste dispenser station.  Looking for something to pout the paste in he came across bowls, utensils and a cup.  Grabbing one of each it wasn’t long before he had both filled.   


He walked over to where Varda stood looking out the viewport.    Taking a seat he started eating the paste.  While it wasn’t very tasty it fulfilled a need.   One his stomach had been protesting since he woke up.  **”How long Varda?”**  He didn’t specify how long for what.  He figured it was a given considering their circumstances.

She turns to him and takes a seat next to him. Manualy pouring him a cup. Listening to his question she opens her mouth. "**Hmm, about six-hundred years give or take**"

Wes let out a breath as Varda said six-hundred years.  How was it even possible?  He had never heard of anything like this being possible.  This ship.   Eve and the incredible tech he’s seen since waking up.  


He looked across the table and then over to where Vaeros sat.  The Inquisitor had chosen to sit across the room alone and secluded.  Not wanting to think about that topic right away, he turned back to Varda.  **”I can’t imagine nine years.  Six-hundred seems unfathomable.   Eve seems to have access to a large database.  She looked for someone who,”**  He paused for a second.  **”Someone who was special to me.  Her records stop at the beginning of the Jedi purge.  I know she was alive up to where there gap in my memory happens but in the nine years since.  I don’t know.”**  


He took a few more bites of the pastes the bland substance was beginning to fulfill his hunger pains.   **”There’s a lingering question.  Why us and why now?”**  Even though his voice wasn’t loud it carried in the quiet space of the galley.

she nods s few times and follows wes' train of thought. "**I fear it's slightly different for me**" She pauses, "**I am old... I am under no illusion I will live perhaps four or five more years.  My... family knew I was old. They most likely think I left before my death, they were very aware I did not wish them to see it.  i am also due to certain... things used to living in a time not the present.  This is like a final last adventure before I join my Daughter and Grandson in the land of the spirits.**"

Wes nodded as he took a sip of the hot tea.   It did taste good but it wasn’t a replacement for caf.  Taking another sip he set the cup down on the table.   Her mentioning of being an old woman with little life left ahead of her was somewhat surprising.   Old she may be but she was still strong.  Yet he held no disillusioned hopes.   **”I don’t know Varda.   None of us have a set expiration date.   Someone put all of us together and it's been at least 600 years in the making.”**  He was silent for a moment before speaking again.  **”The question is why did we wake up now?   I know the obvious answer is the slaver ship but was it just a coincidence or was it the will of the Force?”**

Iyola had had a long and dreamless sleep.  When she awoke, she wondered for a second if it had all indeed been some kind of hallucination. But when she finally opened her eyes, she saw the same dull cubicle from the day before.  *Here she was, trapped in the future. *

She made her way to the galley, where something - finally - smelled appetizing.

Iyola stood in the doorway for a moment, watching her odd set of companions, just in time to hear Del-Fin’s last question.

**“If this is a Force thing, why am I here?”** she interjected.** " I’m not a Jedi. I don’t use Force magic.  It can’t be that.  We all slipped up and made a mistake, and it’s bad luck.  Maybe we got caught in an experiment of some kind.  Something swapped my dataries for gems and wiped all the data and starmaps I had. Pretty sure a Jedi didn’t ruin my life because of Force stuff.”**

She approached the table.  

**“Also, if there is any more of that stuff, can I have some?  It smells delicious.”  **

Wes turned his head at Iyola’s question.   He had heard the galley doors open but wasn’t initially sure who it was.   He hadn't known them long enough to know them by their presence in the Force.  Except Vaeros.   Of all aboard the ship he could pick out the Inquisitor easily.  


**“I don’t think it’s all about the Force Iyola.  I’m sure it plays a part but not the only part.   Did we all mess up somehow like you just said?   Maybe.  I woke up with a scar on my midsection that I don’t remember having before and my armor was compromised in that same section.  Yet it’s now fixed and I don’t remember that either.”**  He looked from the young woman to Varda.  **”I hope that we find out the reasons for our situation and why it’s taken hundreds of years to come to pass.”**

Vaeros quietly listens to the conversation. He's not one to socialize, especially with that Jedi giving him inconsistent dagger-like stares previously. He finishes the first bowl and walks towards the dispensers for seconds. *It seems like my appetite is picking back up, so I guess I'll get my fill before we do something else.* 

As he feels his bowl, he asks Eve, **"Is there any reason why we’re at Kinoonie?”**

Varda speaks up slightly. "**I spoke to Eve while on the bridge. Their are files and information available to a certain degree of rank. something like protector I think,   I imagine we will eventually learn why and how we're here. It mag purely just be a waiting game.**" She twitches her finger at Iyolas question and a cup sails over. the pot rises and pours into it. She smiles warmly.  "**I'll always have a cup for those who want it**"

Iyola watched, fascinated, as Varda floated the cup of liquid over to her.  She barely remembered to grab it.  

She took a sip.  **“It’s good!”** she exclaimed. ** “Reminds me of a mint swirl.  Drank those all the time when I was a youngling.  Thanks, Varda.”  ** She downed the cup in a few more gulps, then grabbed a dish, walked over to the paste dispenser, and grabbed a portion of nutripaste, eating it while standing.

**“So,”** she asked Varda between  big bites, **“you said you weren’t a Jedi, but you can obviously do Force magic.  So how does that work? Did you quit the Order to get married or something?”  **

After she’d gobbled down the tasteless slop, Iyola tossed the dish back on the counter.  **“I’m going to go explore the ship,” **she said. **“Eve said we needed a few more hours to power up.  Oh, and has anyone seen Misha?**” *She might be in the engineering room*, Iyola thought. *I’ll head there first.*

Eve's voice responds to Vaeros, emanating calmly from the galley's speakers. **"This system was selected for its optimal tactical and logistical parameters. First, it is uninhabited and located in an unaligned sector, minimizing the probability of detection by Imperial or other hostile patrols. Second, its G-type star provides a high-efficiency energy source for recharging the solar collectors, a process which is currently underway."**

A moment later, as Iyola heads for the exit, Eve's voice addresses her directly.

**"The guest designated 'Misha' is currently in the port-side barracks. My internal sensors indicate she is currently sleeping."**

Simultaneously, the bracer computer on Wes's gauntlet chimes softly. The screen displays a simple, clear notification: `NADIA SKIRATA: REVIVAL SEQUENCE INITIATION IN 35 STANDARD MINUTES.`

Wes watched as the four of them were alone in the galley.   Varda and Iyola were friendly yet Vaeros was keeping his distance.   Dryzan was absent and the Mandalorian guessed that he was still sleeping.  


At Vaeros’ question as to why Kinooine Wes turned as if to answer.   His expression was passive and more calm then the evening before where adrenaline had been running high.   Eve beat him to the punch answering in detail about needing to recharge and the system was the best place in range.    


With the question answered the Inquisitor looked as if he was about to go back to the table he was previously at.   Wes grabbed his attention and guested to the table he and Varda were sharing.   There was a defined divide between him and the darksider but for some reason the Force had thrown them together.    Master Chase would probably say this would be a time for introspection not battle.     


The soft audible chime on his bracer let him know that it would soon be time to go and see Nadia.   The young Mandalorian they as a group, rescued from the slaver ship just the day before.  **”Eve will be bringing Nadia out of the healing stasis in thirty-five minutes.  I plan on being there when she wakes up.”**

Satisfied with Varda's answer, he nods. As he looks back, Eve quickly answers about the solar collectors and it partially slips past him. *I can never get used to Eve being able to answer and listen wherever.*

**“Got it, thanks, Eve.”** Once the bowl is filled, he returns to his table to finish his meal.  A meditation, training, or writing would be appropriate after this meal. 

Before he walks towards his table, Wes gestures to him, *Sithspit* he thinks.  Vaeros nods and sits at an open spot. **“Is there something on your mind?”**

Iyola glanced back as Vaeros joined Del-Fin and Varda.  She admittedly was curious about how that conversation would go, but she couldn’t resist being the first one to fully explore the Venture.  *That would be a great distraction.  *

**“See you all later!”**  she said, trying to infuse cheer into her voice. 

Eve let her know that Misha was still sleeping.  Iyola made a snap decision to swing by the storage/rec/workshop area instead.  *Maybe there was something interesting left in those spaces.  *

**“Eve,”** she asked as she set off, **“how long has the Venture been around?”**

**"My active operational logs indicate this vessel was commissioned for its current mission parameters approximately three standard decades ago,"** Eve's voice replies, her tone as placid as ever.

**"Data pertaining to its original construction, project designation, or any service history prior to that commissioning is archived and requires 'Protector Level' clearance to access."**

Iyola leaves the galley, stepping out into a corridor that is now fully and steadily illuminated. The oppressive, moving bubble of light is gone, replaced by a clean, continuous glow from the overhead panels. The ship no longer feels like a tomb; it feels like a silent, empty, waiting vessel.

Following the schematic on her datapad, she makes her way through a series of identical, spartan corridors, past the empty barracks, and deeper into the ship's mid-section. The doors to the areas marked 'Storage' and 'Workshop' hiss open as she approaches.

The space inside is vast, a multi-level bay that likely serves as both the primary cargo hold and the main workshop. A heavy-duty lift platform sits dormant in the center, and the upper walls are lined with catwalks and sealed storage lockers, each marked with arcane, alphanumeric designations.

Unlike the rest of the ship, which is almost clinically sterile, this area shows faint signs of having once been a place of active work. There are faded scuff marks on the deck plating where heavy equipment was once dragged. Workbenches are bolted to the walls, their surfaces wiped clean but bearing the faint scars and chemical stains of countless projects. Empty tool racks and powered-down fabrication units line one wall.

It feels like a space that was meticulously scrubbed and decommissioned. All the tools, all the projects, all the personal effects of the last crew to work here have been systematically and thoroughly removed. The only things left are the fixtures, the faint ghosts of past labor, and a profound sense of emptiness. It is a perfectly functional workshop, waiting for a new crew and a new purpose.

Protector - there was that word again.  Though it was interesting in of itself that the ship had been retrofitted 30 years ago. 

**“How do I get Protector Level Clearance, Eve?”**  Iyola asked.

She looked around the space  as she entered.  Between the cargo hold and the workshop, it was gigantic. She wondered if the entire *Stardust Seeker* could fit in here.  Thinking of her home ship brought on a brief, intense pang of sadness. *What had happened to her, to lose everything?*

Iyola shook her head.  *No time for that, not now.* The workshop had a few large pieces of equipment that were vaguely intriguing, but what really piqued her interest was the row of lockers on the upper catwalk.   This ship had clearly been scrubbed, *but no one can catch everything. *

Iyola looked around for the best route to access the catwalk.  She could use her ascender, of course, but there might be a ladder. At the very least, a free climb here would be fun.

**"The protocols for granting 'Protector Level' clearance are not stored in my accessible data banks,"** Eve replies, her voice emanating from a nearby speaker grille. **"It is not a status that can be applied for or granted through standard ship protocols. Access is granted by an authorized agent of the Protector directive upon verification of their unique biometric and psycho-reactive designation inherent to authorized personnel. I am not authorized to grant such clearance."**

The answer is a polite but firm dead end.

Iyola turns her attention back to the workshop. The catwalks are approximately ten meters above the main deck, a significant but not impossible height. A quick scan of the area reveals her options.

The main lift platform in the center of the bay is clearly the primary method for reaching the upper catwalks. Its controls, however, are dark and unresponsive, likely deactivated to conserve power or awaiting a primary systems reboot. 

At the far end of the bay, a standard-issue maintenance ladder is bolted to the wall, leading directly up to the main catwalk level. The bay walls themselves are not sheer; they are a network of thick power conduits, structural support beams, and recessed maintenance panels, offering a challenging but feasible path for a skilled climber. Above, the heavy girders supporting the catwalks are exposed, providing numerous solid anchor points for her ascension cable.

**“Protector Directive, huh?” ** Iyola mused out loud. What she could piece together right now was that the Venture had been repurposed 30 years ago by these Protectors.  But she’d been somewhere else before that.  She had been frozen for centuries.  *Where?*

Iyola’s eyes fell on the ladder.  That would be easy enough.  Maybe she’d use the workshop wall later, for climbing practice.  She started the climb up the ladder to the catwalk level.

Iyola climbs the maintenance ladder with ease, her boots ringing on the metal rungs. The catwalk offers a commanding view of the cavernous workshop below. The air up here is still and silent. She approaches the first bank of storage lockers. They are simple, grey, utilitarian containers, each sealed with a basic electronic lock that is currently unpowered. A manual release latch allows her to open them.

The first locker is empty. The second, the third, the fourth—all empty, wiped clean, not even a speck of dust remaining. The scrub was professional, thorough, and disheartening. She moves to the very last locker in the row, tucked away in a corner where the main lights cast a deep shadow. She pops the latch.

This one, too, is empty. For a moment, she feels a pang of disappointment. But as she starts to close the door, a faint, metallic scraping sound catches her ear. Something small and heavy just rolled in the back.

Kneeling down, she peers into the dark recess. There, tucked into the far corner behind a support strut, is something the cleanup crew missed. It's a handheld device, about the size of a heavy-duty hydrospanner. It's made of a dull, non-reflective metal, heavy for its size, with an ergonomic grip on one end and a complex-looking, crystalline emitter on the other. A small, dark viewscreen and a single, multi-function dial are its only controls. It looks like some kind of highly specialized diagnostic or calibration tool, unremarkable enough to be easily overlooked. When she picks it up, she feels a faint, almost imperceptible hum vibrating from within it.

Wes was actually surprised when Vaeros came by and sat down.  Since finding out they were on opposite sides of the war both were on edge.   It didn’t help that they all woke up on edge and compromised from the cryo sleep they all experienced.   He wasn’t surprised at the blunt quip directed at him.   **”Look, yesterday was a stressful day.  We all woke up disoriented and confused.    While some of the confusion still remains, the disorientation is removed.   We don’t know why we’re here.   It’s something, despite the obvious differences, someone thought important enough to put us all together.  I want to find out why.   Why such a disparity in the times we came from?”**  He looked from vaeros to Varda.

With a practiced nonchalance, Iyola leaned into the locker, seized the hydrospanner, and  slipped it into one of the pockets in her blue-green jacket.  Clearly, this gadget - whatever it was for - wasn’t supposed to be here. She’d wait to examine it until she was off the ship, whenever that might be. Not for a few hours at least; Eve was still powering up. 

Heartened by her find, Iyola scampered down the ladder and headed toward the recreation facility, which by the map should be just adjacent to the workshop/cargo area. A spirited game of dejarik would be fun.  She wondered if she could play against Eve.  *No, she’d drag one of the others down here to play with her.*

The doors to the recreation facility slide open, revealing a space that is a stark, almost jarring contrast to the utilitarian nature of the rest of the ship. This room was clearly designed for the long-term mental well-being of a crew.

The lighting is warmer, softer. In the center of the room, a holographic dejarik table sits dormant, its projector dark. Comfortable-looking lounge chairs are arranged in a conversational grouping in one corner. Along another wall, a series of what look like enclosed simulation pods are powered down, their access doors sealed.

But what truly dominates the space is the far wall. It is not metal, but a massive, floor-to-ceiling holoscreen, currently displaying a breathtaking, hyper-realistic, and deeply serene image: a dense, alien forest of impossibly tall, bioluminescent trees, their glowing canopies filtering a soft, purple twilight. The image is not static; there is a gentle, almost imperceptible sway to the trees, the slow drift of glowing spores in the air. The scene is utterly silent, but it radiates a profound sense of peace and tranquility.

Like the workshop, the room has been scrubbed of any personal effects—no stray datapads, no half-finished games, no personal trinkets. It is a perfectly preserved, perfectly empty space, waiting to be used.

Vaeros pauses for a moment, moving his left pointer finger along his facial scar in thought. **"I haven't thought about it. I can't piece together how such large gaps could occur; the High Republic, Dawn of the Empire, and a high of the Empire. What is something that such a large time gap could provide?"**

**"Anyways, I digress. I want to resolve this and go my separate ways. I have no desire to be substantially implicated in whatever this is."**

**“Ooh,” **says Iyola out loud as she beholds the wonders of the recreation room.  The huge holoimage on the wall reminds her of her adventures of Xylos, searching for the Sunken Star.  She’d rescued her rival, Hextor Ambur, and she and Caz had charged his rich father quadruple the usual rate for his retrieval, which the senior Ambur paid without (much) complaint.  Not to mention the star map data she’d found.  *She and Caz had officially un-broken up that night.*

The grief hit her unexpectedly.  Iyola curled up in one of the cushy lounge chairs and wept. After a while, she pulled herself together and wiped her face off on her shirt. 

**“Eve, please change the image to something else pretty.  No jungles.”** 

She walks over to the dejarik table, looking for a way to activate the game.

** “Hey Eve, if those three are done with whatever they’re talking about”**  - *hopefully not arguing about *-  “**in the galley, can you ask them to come here and play dejarik with me?”**

 **“Also, what’s in those pods over there?” **

The massive holoscreen on the wall wavers for a moment, the serene image of the bioluminescent jungle dissolving into a cascade of soft, blue light. The light coalesces into a new, equally breathtaking scene: a slow, silent drift through a vibrant, alien coral reef. Schools of tiny, silver fish dart between impossible structures of glowing, crimson coral, and a colossal, gentle creature resembling a manta ray glides peacefully in the simulated deep.

Iyola turns to the dejarik table. As if sensing her intent, the circular surface hums to life. A ring of light glows around its edge, and the projector in the center flickers, casting the three-dimensional, holographic forms of the game pieces onto the board. A grotesque Kintan Strider snarls silently at a lithe Ghhhk bird. The game is ready.

**"Acknowledged,"** Eve's voice states, emanating from the rec room's speakers. **"Cycling environmental simulation. 'Jungle' parameter excluded. Dejarik table activated. Game logic and holographic projectors are online. Awaiting players."**

She pauses for a fraction of a second before continuing.

**"I will relay your request to the crew members currently located in the galley. The units you are referring to are designated as 'Full Immersion Environmental Simulators,' or 'Simulation Pods.' They are designed for long-duration crew missions to provide psychological enrichment, skill-based training simulations, and recreational scenarios. However, the primary simulation library database is currently inaccessible."**

Wes listened as Vaeros talked.  He wanted answers.  They all did.  Vaeros, much like himself, may still have a place to go to.   The others did not.   Time was their enemy while they slept and it wasn’t a benevolent one.  


**”We all will be looking for answers.  There’s far too many questions to ignore.   I do have a question and it’s an important one.”**  His gaze left Vaeros and shifted to Varda.   He said back taking a more relaxed posture.   An attempt at keeping tensions low.   **“We need to work together.   Despite the differences in ethos and beliefs, can we work together to unravel this mystery?”**

Iyola explored the rest of the recreation room as she waited for one of her companions to arrive.  As with the cargo hold, this place had been scrubbed thoroughly.  No dice, no sabacc chips. Not even any exercise equipment.  Maybe that was confined to the pods.

**“Why are the pods inaccessible?” ** Iyola asked Eve, a hint of a whine entering her voice.**  “Can you at least show a holodrama while I’m waiting?”**  She thought for a moment.  **“Like *The Sficca of Naboo*, something like that?”**

**"The Full Immersion Environmental Simulators are classified as non-essential, high-draw systems,"** Eve's voice replies, the sound emanating from a speaker grille near the dejarik table. **"While the vessel is in a primary power regeneration cycle, all non-essential systems are automatically shunted offline to prioritize the recharging of the main drive, shields, and life support."**

She continues, addressing Iyola's second request.

**"Searching... Negative. My data archives do not contain a media library for recreational holodramas. My primary function is operational support and the preservation of mission-relevant historical and tactical data. Popular entertainment is not included in my provisioning."**

As Wes, Varda, and Vaeros sit in the sterile quiet of the galley, each lost in their own thoughts, Eve's calm, synthesized voice emanates from a speaker on the wall. **"Crew member Iyola Kett has activated the dejarik table in the primary recreation facility. She has extended an invitation for any available crew members to join her for a game."** The message is delivered with the flat, informational tone of a transit announcement, a simple statement of fact that hangs in the quiet air between them.

Wes gave Vaeros a nod at his declaration of giving his word.   Despite the man's snide comment that he may not take the man at his word.  He figured Vaeros hadn't had many dealings with Mandalorians.   If he had he would know that taking someone’s word was important.   Until it was broken there was no need to think otherwise.   


He was going to respond but Eve interrupted the three of them with an invitation from Iyola in the recreational facility.  He saw the shift in the man’s eyes as he answered that he was on the way.  Wes calmly stood as well.   **”Vaeros,”** He said to grab the man’s attention before he walked away.    **”Thank you.  You have my word as well.”**  


As Vaeros walked out he turned back to Varda and looked at the timer for Nadia.   Eve was going to wake her up in fifteen minutes.   He wanted to be there.  While he wouldn’t be a familiar face his armor would.   He hoped that it would put her at ease.  **”Eve is set to bring Nadia out of the healing cycle in about fifteen minutes.  Would you like to be there when that happens?  If you’d like to meet me there when you're ready it could be another friendly voice for her.”**  Picking up his helmet he turned for the door intent on heading to the Medbay.   


Moments later he passed through the doors into the Medbay.  He turned his helmeted head towards the status screen of the pod that Nadia was in.   **”Eve, how is Nadia doing?  Is there anything I need to be watchful for when she wakes and afterwards?”**

Leaving the quiet contemplation of the galley, Vaeros follows the ship's internal signage. The steadily lit corridors, all identical grey metal and soft, indirect light, guide him aft. The ship is a silent, sterile labyrinth, and he moves through it with a deliberate, measured pace, the only sound the soft fall of his own boots.

The doors to the recreation facility slide open before him, revealing a space that is a stark, almost jarring contrast to the utilitarian nature of the ship. The lighting is warmer, softer. In the center of the room, the holographic dejarik table is now active, its miniature monsters frozen mid-snarl, awaiting the start of a game. Comfortable-looking lounge chairs are arranged in one corner, and along the far wall, the massive holoscreen displays a slow, silent drift through a vibrant, alien coral reef.

Iyola is there, standing by the dejarik table, looking up from the holographic pieces as he enters. The room, like the rest of the ship, is scrubbed clean of any personal touch, but here, at least, there is a sense of manufactured peace, a deliberate attempt at creating a space for rest in the cold, empty void.

Wes enters the silent, sterile medbay. The only sounds are the soft hum of the active machinery and the faint, rhythmic pulse of the bio-monitors on Nadia's cryo-chamber. The timer on its side now reads `00:15:00`. He stands before the chamber, a silent vigil in the cool, white light.

Eve's synthesized voice emanates from the medbay's integrated speakers, her tone as clinical as the room itself.

**"Subject Nadia's physiological condition is stable and improving. Cellular regeneration is proceeding within expected parameters. She is no longer in a critical state."**

She pauses, processing his second question.

**"Regarding post-reanimation observations: you should anticipate significant muscle fatigue and a period of psychological disorientation. Her system has endured extreme trauma."**

Another fractional pause, as if she is cross-referencing a new data point.

**"Your designation of the subject as 'Force Sensitive' has been noted. During the regeneration cycle, my neurological scanners detected several instances of spontaneous, high-amplitude theta-wave activity that did not correlate with any internal stimuli. This suggests a potential for extreme sensory hypersensitivity upon waking. I would advise maintaining a calm emotional state and a low vocal tone in her presence. Strong emotional displays from others may act as a painful or disorienting stimulus for her."**

Iyola looks up from the dejarik game as Vaeros enters the room, her gray eyes brightening.  The combined hues of the deep-sea holomovie and the illumination of the dejarik board flicker oddly across her face.

**“Ready to play?” ** she asks Vaeros.  She glances over to the pods.  **“Most of the exercise and  recreation functions in those pods are shut off because Eve needs the power to keep us alive and fly the ship. But maybe this dejarik board has its own power source.”  **

Iyola sweeps her hand above the holographic creatures.  **“Because I invited you, you get to choose your first piece,”** she says.

Vaeros enters, looking around the room, before nodding at Iyola. He's almost awe-stricken, since he's never been one to check these kinds of games out.

Wes nodded as Eve gave him the sitrep of Nadia. She was still going to be in a compromised state.  The quieter and calmer the environment was, the better.  **”Understood Eve.  Perhaps cutting the lights down from their current brightness when the procedure to wake her is started is advisable.”**   


He let out a breath as he looked at the chrono and back to Nadia.  Thought began to run through his mind.   What were the odds of running across another Force Sensitive Mandalorian.   The numbers simply didn’t seem possible.  And then there was the feeling he had when he first sensed her. That slight feeling of familiarity.   If anything caused him confusion it was that. 


**”Eve can you compile what you know of the Mandalorian clan, Skirita.   Who the major players are within and where they may be located.  If we can get her and Derek to them that might be advantageous.   They may be able to give us some insight as to the current pile of poodoo the galaxy is in.”**

Iyola raises an eyebrow.  **“You’ve never played dejarik?  Is it extinct in your time or something?”**  She's being facetious; she knows that it existed at least 30 years ago. Still, he must not have been asleep as long as she was. **“How long were you in the meat locker?” **

**“So there are a lot of different variants of dejarik.  But we’ll play the version I like, which is Spira Draft.  You choose which pieces you want on your side. Typically when you move a piece into another player’s square, you win that square and eliminate that piece.  There are exceptions, but we won’t play with those, because you’re new.  Some of the pieces move differently than others.  But we can go through those as we play.”** Once again, she points to the first two pieces. ** “That’s a Kintan, and it can push other pieces on your side one space if it’s next to them.  It moves one space at a time, only up/down and left/right.  That’s a Ghhhk, and it can move diagonally, any number of spaces.” **

**“Oh, and usually you have to remember which ones are yours, but since you’re new I’ll ask Eve to color-code them once you choose.”**

**"Your directive is logical. I will dim the medbay lighting to twenty percent standard illumination prior to initiating the revival sequence,"** Eve confirms. A moment of silence passes as the AI processes the new, complex data request.

**"Searching accessible archives for 'Clan Skirata'..."**

The AI's voice continues, its tone a flat recitation of historical and commercial data.

**"Historical records from the Clone Wars era note 'Clan Skirata' as a Mandalorian clan of some renown, primarily due to the activities of one Kal Skirata, a training sergeant who served as a consultant and paternal figure to several elite Republic Commando units. His activities are well-documented in Republic military archives."**

**"Post-Imperial establishment, detailed public records on the internal structures of most Mandalorian clans become sparse. However, cross-referencing commercial registries yields a high-probability match."**

**"A registered corporate entity named 'Kando's Coursers, LLC' operates out of Port Town on Cloud City, Bespin. Its listed services are high-end security, asset retrieval, and information brokerage. The registered proprietor of this firm is an individual named Ghurn Skirata. Given the name and cultural affiliation, it is logical to conclude that this is a base of operations for the clan you are seeking."**

**"Beyond Ghurn Skirata, there are no other individuals of that clan name listed in any public or corporate registries that are accessible to me."**

**“No, now you just place your piece and I place mine.  Because you chose yours first, you place first.  Since you have a Ghhhk, place it near the center of the board so you have maximum flexibility to move.  I have a Kintan which can maximize the movement of some of my other pieces, so wherever I place it will end up being my base of operations, so to speak.  So watch carefully.”**  Iyola placed her Kintan in the corner pocket on the left side nearest her. ** “Make my playing pieces green,”** she said.  She figured either the dejarik board or Eve could fulfill the command, but if not there were usually manual settings.

**“The board will then select two other random pieces and we go from there, trading drafts, so I go first next time. Spira Draft starts with 8 pieces and then there’s a twist that I’ll explain later.” **  In retrospect, she probably should have started with the youngling version of dejarik, but she was committed now, *and  besides, she really did like Spira Draft *. **“Once we choose and place four pieces each, the game begins.  You can either pick up the piece and put in in the space where you want it, or push it along the board.  In your case, you should push it so you can get a better sense of how the pieces move.”** 

Iyola looked up at Vaeros with frank curiosity.  **“I have to ask,”** she said. **“Where and how did you grow up that a simple game of dejarik was such a luxury?” **

As Vaeros moves the Ghhhk piece, he looks at Iyola 

** "Well, when you are constantly fighting, you often don't have the luxury to slowdown. Think of it as being raised in very specific niches that fit your characteristics. For an example, I was raised in the Jedi Order as apart of the Jedi Exploration Corps, but you might know it as the ExplorCorps. I trained in navigation, survival, and light saber duals. Think of it like a ruin explorer, star charter, and so on. This type of people are often illusive, and decentralized from the order. "

"That's just my upbringing though; when I left the order to serve in the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I used my skills to chart paths for Count Dooku, one of my mentors. I also fought Jedi, clones, and bandits, that kind of stuff to furfil my missions."

"I do something similar in the Empire as well, but that's another long spiel. I basically just haven't had the freedom, or interest. I like exploring, instead. **

The info Eve dug up made sense and filled in a few holes.   He remembered the name Kal Skirita but only in passing.   Remembering his father mentioning the name on one occasion.   From what he could remember his father held Kal and the Skirita in high regard.  Knowing what family means to a clan he knew they would be happy to have one of their own back.     


Varda's own recollection from hundreds of years ago only seems to cement the info Eve dug up.   It also made him wonder about his own clan and his Father Cal, the head of Clan Del-Fin.  They were in a precarious situation having one of their own hunted by the Empire simply for being what he was.    


**”It follows what I know of them during the clone war.  It’s good to know that some things don’t change.”**  He glanced at the screen and looked at Eve’s face.  **”Eve, what can you tell me of the Mandalorian clan Del-Fin.  Lead by Cal Del-Fin.”**  He took a breath as he waited for what she knew.

Eve's face remains impassive on the screen as she processes the new query. The silence stretches for a few seconds longer than usual, a subtle indication of a more difficult and fragmented search.

**"Searching... Clan Del-Fin,"** she begins, her voice a flat recitation of data points. **"Records from the late Republic era confirm Clan Del-Fin, led by Cal Del-Fin, operated under direct contract with the Republic military. Their last confirmed assignment was providing covert combat support to local resistance forces on the Separatist-held world of Raxus Prime."**

She pauses, collating the chaotic records from the dawn of the Empire.

**"Following the issuance of Order 66 and the subsequent Imperial consolidation of Raxus Prime, all official Republic contracts were rendered void. Imperial military logs from that period are heavily redacted, but they report significant armed conflict with unsanctioned Mandalorian forces and local insurgents. Communications intercepts from various independent sources in the years immediately following the battle indicate that remnants of Clan Del-Fin successfully broke the Imperial blockade and escaped Raxus Prime, but they were scattered and suffered heavy casualties."**

The final piece of information is delivered with the same sterile finality as all the others.

**"In the subsequent nineteen years, there are no official records, commercial registries, or credible intelligence reports indicating any organized resurgence or public activity from a group identifying as Clan Del-Fin. Their current status is unknown."**

**“Of course I know the ExplorCorps!”  exclaimed Iyola.  “I was in the Survey Corps myself, before I went independent.  We worked alongside the ExplorCorps sometimes, and some of our trainers were in the ExplorCorps.  I got to know a bunch of Jedi.”  * **Some better than others, of course.** * We should trade stories.  I bet you’ve been in some interesting places too.” **

She looked at Vaeros thoughtfully.  **“You know, when I was a tiny youngling, I wanted to be a Jedi.  I had a wild imagination.  My parents told me if I joined the Jedi I would have to work and fight all the time, and I’d never have fun or see my family again.  Who knows, maybe they were right, if you didn’t even get to play baby dejarik.”  **
 
Iyola shook her head.  “**I don’t know who this Count Dooku is or what the deal is with the clones.  I keep hearing about a Clone War and I don’t know what that is.  But - what is this about fighting Jedi?  I still don’t know why the Jedi would fight you.  They don’t fight unless they have to. They would have just left you alone.” **

She glanced at the board to see which pieces had been randomly chosen.  “**OK, the next pieces are the Monnok and Grimtaash.  Monnok has one of the highest ranges since it can damage a piece from three squares away.  Grimtaash has high defense.” ****

He let out a big sigh.  The thought of his Father and clan holed up on Raxus Prime still sat poorly within him.   He could still remember the garbled communications he had with his Father after Order 66.  His urgent plea to join them on Raxus Prime and his fathers order to stay away.   Cal knew as well as Wes did.  That the Empire would be looking for him.  That if his son didn’t stay on the run he’d be captured and killed or worse.  


It was the only time he ever considered disobeying an order from his father.  Now another nine years had passed with no mention of Clan Del-Fin.   It might as well have been millennia.    


**”That pretty much sums up what I know of what happened to my father and Clan Del-Fin.   If they scattered and went to ground, like my father always had a plan for, the Empire would never find them.  Well not all of them.   He’d buy his time before coming back if he was able to.   Another mystery to unravel.”**  


As Varda asked her own question to Eve his thoughts turned to Marina as he reached out into the Force.   Their bond always allowed them to know the other was alright.  See glimpses of what the other saw.  He hadn’t tried since waking up.   The way Eve made it sound he was shit off from the Force while in cryo.   That meant that she wouldn’t have been able to sense him.  Possibly thinking he was dead.  It was a sobering thought as he let his senses drift out to her in the moments he had left on the timer.

**"Searching..."** Eve's voice replies. The pause this time is brief, almost instantaneous.

**"Negative. My accessible archives contain no verifiable records of a 'Clan Senn' in any historical, military, or commercial registries from the last five decades. The name does not correspond to any known, active Mandalorian clan."**

Wes closes his eyes, the sterile white of the medbay fading away as he turns his focus inward. He pushes past the immediate concerns—the ship, the strangers, the impossible gulf of time—and reaches for the one constant he has known for over a decade. It is a familiar, practiced act, like drawing a favored weapon. He casts the line of his consciousness out across the star-strewn void, seeking the unique, resonant hum in the Force that is Marina. It has always been there, a warm, steady light, sometimes faint with distance, but never, ever gone.

But when his senses arrive at the place she *should* be, there is nothing.

It is not just silence; it is a profound deafness where a constant, beautiful song used to be. The connection, the bond that has been a steady, reassuring presence in the back of his mind for over a decade, is not merely quiet. It is gone. Severed.

He recoils, the psychic shock a physical blow that makes him take an involuntary step back. He reaches out again, desperately this time, a frantic search for a thread that has been cut clean through. But there is only a cold, gaping void. A raw, empty space where a vital part of his own spirit used to be.

The Force, in its infinite and often cruel wisdom, offers only one explanation for a silence so absolute.

*1403836895720505425*

Since the awakening of his ability with the Force Marina had always been there.  The bond they shared was one the Order had never heard of before.   It was what made them or perhaps just her master, Silas, decide to seperate them.  Neither of them had asked for it.  It just happened.  Was it a result of the feelings and love they had for each other.  He didn’t know but he knew neither of them would ever ask for it to change.   


Reaching out to her, sensing her presence, had become as easy as drawing breath.  When he found nothing he almost panicked.  Again he tried and again his attempt only resulted in an a profound emptiness.  An emptiness that only meant on thing.   The bond was no more.  


He took a weak step back.  The shock was a physical blow directly on the newly found scar on his midsection.   He felt it ache physically and within the Force.  As his hand rose to the same spot that his Beskar covered he reached out a third time.  Now the silence was deafening.  His mind screamed that it want possible but the reality was that the silence didn’t lie.    


She was gone.


**”Marina.”** He said softly.  **”Please forgive me that I wasn’t there.”**  While the words were spoken softly there was a profound heaviness of sorrow and regret in the tone and his presence.


A moment later the timer on his HUD began flashing red.   There was one minute left.  He blinked back the tears and pushed the feelings deep.   He needed time to reflect on them but this certainly wasn’t that time. When that time did come he’d be ready to embrace the somber realization that his love was gone.

A soft chime echoes through the medbay, drawing Wes from his grief. The countdown on his bracer, and on the larger monitor on the wall, flashes `00:01:00`.

**"Revival sequence will initiate in one standard minute,"** Eve's voice states, cutting through the heavy silence. **"I will now reduce ambient lighting."**

The bright, sterile lights of the medbay dim to a soft, low glow, just enough to see by, creating a calmer, more subdued atmosphere.

The lid of the cryo-chamber begins to retract with a soft hiss, revealing Nadia's still, unconscious form. A tray slides out from a compartment beneath the diagnostic bed she was on earlier. On it rests a neatly folded set of simple, grey shipboard fatigues—clean, sterile, and anonymous.

**"The subject is physiologically stable. When the cycle completes, she will regain consciousness naturally over a period of approximately ninety seconds. Medical intervention should not be necessary unless she displays signs of extreme neurological distress. I will be monitoring her vital signs."**

The timer hits zero. A final, prolonged hiss escapes the chamber as the last of the cryo-gas is vented, and the soft blue light within fades, leaving Nadia resting in the quiet dimness, on the verge of waking.

Wes stood there as he buried the feelings of Marina.   Try as he might there were still some residual thoughts and memories that rattled around inside his head.   The cave on Fakir after they purged the kyber crystal.  When they said goodbye after the Order had decided to separate them.  The memory of her walking away still felt as if he was watching part of himself walk away.  


Eve's voice brought him back to the here and now.    **”Understood Eve. You keep an eye on her and we will do the same.”**. 


Wes watched the timer count down to zero.   As the clock stopped the tell tale hiss of the chamber sounded.  The blue light from within died away and the chamber opened up.  Inside lay Nadia still asleep but on the verge of waking up.  He saw her eyes flutter and her chest rise.  


He spoke softly in Mando’a. || **”You are safe Nadia.  You’re aboard our ship after rescuing you from the slaver ship.  You’ve been in our Medbay for a short time.  You can move but don’t rush it.  There are some clean fatigues to your right side.”** ||


He stood to the side in the same armor as before bearing the colors of his clan and the clans sigil on his left pauldron.   His blaster was at his side and still hanging from his utility belt was his lightsaber hilt.   He hadn’t hidden it yet.  It may have been because of Vaeros.  A known Inquisitor or perhaps he was just tired of keeping it hidden.

As the cryo-chamber's cycle completes, a series of articulated arms extends from the ceiling with silent, fluid grace. They gently lift Nadia's unconscious form from the chamber and transfer her to the now-active diagnostic bed in the center of the room. The bed's bio-scanners immediately light up, casting a soft, analytical blue glow over her.

She lies there, a picture of fragile survival. The bio-sanitization cycle has cleaned away the grime of her captivity, but it could not erase the evidence of it. Her prisoner's smock, now clean, hangs loosely on her gaunt frame. Her skin, where it is not pale from malnutrition, is a faint, ugly tapestry of deep, mottled purple and yellow bruising, most noticeable on her arms and shoulders—the ghosts of brutal grips. She is stabilized, but far from healed.

Her eyelids flutter, a tremor running through her. A low, soft moan escapes her lips as consciousness begins its slow, painful return. She awakens not to a jolt, but to a profound sense of *change*. The agonizing chemical need that has been her constant companion for weeks is gone, replaced by a deep, aching weariness in her body. The world is quiet. She is clean. This sensory disconnect is the first shock.

Her training takes over. She does not panic. She goes completely still, her eyes cracking open to take in the dim, unfamiliar ceiling of the medbay. It is Wes's soft Mando'a that grounds her, the familiar sounds a steady anchor in the disorienting sea of her return. Her eyes, now clear of the drug-induced haze, are terrifyingly alert. They slowly track from the ceiling to the source of the voice, landing on the armored Mandalorian standing a few paces away.

Her gaze locks onto the Mandalorian's sigil for a moment, a flicker of recognition in her otherwise guarded eyes. Her movements are slow, deliberate, as she tests the weakness in her own limbs, pushing herself into a seated position on the edge of the diagnostic bed. The simple prisoner's smock offers no comfort or protection.

Her eyes, now clear of the drug-induced haze, shift from the armored Mandalorian to the old woman with the strange staff, then back again. She is assessing them, her expression a mask of wary neutrality.

She does not respond in Mando'a. When she finally speaks, her voice is a quiet, dry rasp, but it is in perfect, unaccented Basic, each word carefully chosen.

**"Where... am I?"** she asks, her gaze sweeping the sterile white room. **"Who are you?"**

He watched her move her head in an attempt to take in her surroundings.  He could tell that she was trying to figure out if she was in a worse situation than the one she was previously in.   Her head tracked to his voice when he spoke.   Eyes now alert and free of the drugs took him in.   He saw them dart to his shoulder where his sigil was proudly displayed.  The same flicker of recognition flashed for an instant before looking away.   


She began moving.  It was slow and gingerly at first.  As if she was taking in each movement for injury.   The discolored bruises that mostly covered her arms and shoulders apparently bore the brunt of the slavers' physical transgressions against her.  Now in a seated position he watched her look between Varda and himself.  She was doing the same thing he would be if the roles were reversed.   Assessing the situation and reading the room.  Figuring out if those that rescued her were friend or foe.   


Her question wasn’t surprising nor was the unaccented basic. It was straight and to the point.  He reached for a container of water and slowly handed it to her.  **”You’re on the *Venture* with myself, Varda and three others.  And one other that we rescued off the slavers’ ship, Misha.”**  He took a step back after handing off the water.  **”My name is Wes.  Like I said before.   You’re safe here.”**

Nadia's eyes track the container of water, but she makes no move to take it immediately. Her gaze remains fixed on Wes, her expression unreadable. She is processing the information, cross-referencing it with the chaotic, fragmented memories of her rescue. 

Finally she reaches out, her hand steady despite her obvious physical weakness, and takes the water. She doesn't drink, but holds it, her fingers wrapped tightly around the container as if it were an anchor.

Her gaze goes from Wes's face to Varda's, then back again with an unreadable expression, a carefully constructed wall of neutrality.

**"The *Venture*,"** she repeats, the name a flat, toneless statement, not a question. She seems to be testing the word, seeing how it feels. **"And Derek?"** The question is quiet, but it carries a weight that fills the sterile room.

She was cautious and he understood why.  Her question about Derek told him she cared about her friend that tried to save her.  There was no way to tell her than to come right out and say it.  


He shook his head.  The ‘T’ visor moved back and forth.  **”Once he was free of the Twi’lek he ran to where you were.  We followed him to the cargo bay where you were held.  At the door we found him.  He was already dead.   Either the collar was remote activated or the control panel for the door he opened sent a surge out and tripped the collar.  It killed him instantly.”**  He took a breath and looked to the door that led to the other room that held the cryo unit he was placed in.  **”He’s in there, secure in a cryo unit.   You wouldn’t let us leave without him.”**


He paused for a moment as a Mandalorian saying came to mind.  || **”Not gone, simply walking far away.”** ||

Varda doesn't say much yet she stands next to wes a silent watcher. Feeling the emotions of wes change she would shift closer. Offering a hand if he needs. When Nadia wakes she let's a small relieved smile grace her face, in the depths of her mind she somewhat doubted the ships ability to clear all forms of toxins. Her force prescne that hangs around her like a halo shifts to allow nadia space to feel and not be overwhelmed. She leans on her staff and closes her eyes slightly at the mention of Derek.

The news lands not with a cry or a gasp, but with a profound, crushing silence.

Nadia's face, which had been a mask of cautious neutrality, seems to crumble from within. The last flicker of alertness in her eyes extinguishes, leaving them hollow, empty voids. The container of water slips from her numb fingers, clattering onto the deck and spilling its contents in a dark pool at her feet. She doesn't seem to notice.

She stares at the door to the preservation chamber, her gaze fixed on it, but seeing something far away. Her lips part, but no sound comes out. Her carefully constructed walls, the ones that held back the storm of her trauma, have just been breached by a grief so absolute it needs no sound.

The tremors return, a violent, uncontrollable shudder that wracks her entire body. She wraps her arms around herself, hugging her knees to her chest, curling back into that small, tight ball of a survivor, her mind once again retreating from a reality that has become too sharp, too painful to bear.

Time in the medbay seems to slow to a crawl, measured only by the soft, rhythmic beeping of the bio-monitor and Nadia's ragged, shuddering breaths. She remains curled on the edge of the bed, a statue carved from grief, her gaze locked on the door to the preservation chamber. 

Minutes stretch into an eternity. There is no wailing, no screaming—only a profound, crushing stillness that is somehow more terrible. It is the silence of a spirit that has endured the unthinkable only to be met with a final, heartbreaking loss.

Slowly, painstakingly, the warrior within begins to reassert itself. The violent tremors lessen, replaced by a rigid, controlled tension. She takes a single, deep, shuddering breath, the first she seems to have taken since hearing the news.

She does not look at them. She continues to stare at the door. When she finally speaks, her voice is a ghost of its former self, a raw, scraped whisper, but it is steady.

**"His family...,"** she says to the empty air. **"They need to be told. He must be returned."**

It is not a request. It is a statement of sacred duty, the first plank in a new foundation she is desperately trying to build from the wreckage of her world.

Wes watched as she looked to the door he indicated.   It wasn’t immediate but when the emotions took hold she saw the physical impact it had on her as well as feeling it in the Force.  Hearing that her friend was gone tore down the newly recreated wall she had erected to protect herself.   With the wall down he watched as she curled up to protect herself from whatever else the galaxy had in store for her.   


It took a bit of time but she finally started to regain some of that inner strength she had.  He knew it was there as he had witnessed it on the slaver's ship.  She needed to find it once more.   


He turned his attention to the monitors.   All readings were still green but stress levels were still high.   The quietness of the Medbay was deafening but it finally broke when she spoke.  Looking back he witnessed another change in her.   A quiet calmness that was wrapped up tight waiting to unravel.  She wanted to take him home.   


**”Right now the *Venture* has its solar arrays deployed.   We’re in the Kinooine system recharging our critically low power reserves.  When that’s accomplished I see no problem getting you to where you need to go.  Perhaps we may find some help there as well.”**  He paused for a moment.  **”Eve, what's the time left on the solar recharge?   I’d also like to give Nadia passenger status, same as Misha.”**

**"The solar collectors are operating at ninety-eight percent efficiency,"** Eve's voice replies from the medbay speakers, her tone as placid as ever. **"Projected time remaining until minimum operational power is achieved: ten standard hours and twelve standard minutes."**

She continues without a pause.

**"Acknowledged. I have designated the subject 'Nadia' as a non-crew passenger. Her access privileges are now restricted to tertiary systems: atmospheric controls in her immediate vicinity, nutrient dispensers, and sanitation facilities."**

Nadia finally tears her gaze away from the preservation chamber door. She looks at Wes, her eyes still hollowed out by grief, but now with a flicker of cold, pragmatic focus in their depths. The mention of power reserves and system status seems to have grounded her, pulling the soldier back to the surface.

**"Kinooine... unaligned space,"** she murmurs, more to herself than to him, her mind clearly processing the tactical situation. She pushes a stray strand of hair from her face, her movements slow but deliberate.

**"Ten hours is too long to wait. We're a ghost on the sensors now, but that won't last. The *Aether*... they'll report us. The Empire will start looking."**

She shifts on the bed, her voice gaining a fraction more strength, a brittle edge of command.

**"We need a real safe harbor. A place to get parts for this ship, gather intel, and disappear. I know a place. Cloud City, on Bespin. It's... neutral enough. My uncle runs a security firm there. He's discreet. He has resources. He can help us."**

She looks from Wes to Varda, her gaze intense. The grief is still there, a raw wound just beneath the surface, but it is now overlaid with a desperate, single-minded purpose.

**"He's the only one who can help me get Derek home."**

Vaeros drones on slightly,** "Got it..." **He moves the Monnok, using it to prepare for a ranged strike.** "I think that will work."**

Backtracking to the conversation, he looks at Iyola, **"I suppose you would fit the criteria for explorers; it suits you well. As for your family, they are right. Jedi are often brought into the order when they are babies, and do not know their parents. I don't know my parents, but sometimes I wish I did. Having that kind of companionship is often rare and far between in my line of work."**

**"As for the Clone Wars, the Jedi deliberately involved themselves in the war and politics, especially as generals. This caused a massive rift in the order, as it often separated the peacekeepers from the war hawks. I was on the side of the peacekeepers, but due to our skills, we were always used. I did not trust the clones, and neither did most of the Jedi. They viewed them like droids with a human's skin; I didn't, but it felt so weird compared to the Stark Hyperspace war, when it was judicial forces fighting pirates."**

**"Regardless, the Jedi were heavily involved in the war, often as frontline soldiers. The issue was that there were only about 10000 in the order, and even fewer as qualified warriors, so younger padawans or other branches of the Jedi were called to fill the gaps. I did not want to be a part of it, and separated from my Master. If I were to fight, I would fight for a people I can see the positivity being used, and not by the Coruscant elite." **

Vaeros sighs, ** "Of course, I'm partially hypocritical, as I forsook the order and peacekeeping in favor of supporting the Separatists: disenfranchised Republic citizens."**

*1404207206559252502*

Iyola listened intently as Vaeros recounted a history that seemed like a terribly written counterfactual holodrama.  But, she had come to realize, it was true, at least from his viewpoint.

**“So the Jedi fought other people separating from the Republic, and the Jedi became generals and warriors instead of peacekeepers, and there were somehow clones fighting someone.  Is that right?”**  she asked.  *And there had been another war before this one, as well, the Hyperspace War. *  ** “I can ask Eve for the details.  But just tell me, how long ago was this?  What’s the last time you can remember?”**

She sighed a bit. ** “It just seems like everything became terrible. The Jedi I knew were explorers and diplomats and biologists, not warmongers. And they were generally pretty OK.  I mean, a few of them were skugholes and egoists, sure.  They were people, like everyone else, just magic people with a lot of rules.”  **

**“Anyway, we’ve got a game to play.”**  Iyola smiled at Vaeros. ** “So the next two up are the Bulbous and the K’lor.  The Bulbous will kill any piece it sits next to for three turns consecutively. The K'lor  moves up to three spaces in any direction except diagonally.  You chose the last two times first, so now I'm going to pick.""**  With that said, she delicately tapped the Bulbous, placing it in the center left of the board as she faced it.

**“You didn’t color code your pieces,**”  Iyola pointed out.  **“I mean, you technically don’t have to because I color coded mine, but it’s still a good thing to do.”**

Vaeros smiles back, **"Oh! I did forget to change the piece's color. Sorry, sometimes I get a little passionate about things personal to me. I think I'll change mine to yellow. I'm still not entirely understanding this game, but that's the fun part, I suppose."**

Wes saw the shift in Nadia.  Grief, pain and exhaustion still ruled her features about there was a determination there to get her friend home.  When Eve said that they still had over ten hours until minimum operational power Nadia wasn’t happy with that.  Mentioning that the Empire would be looking for them.  


**”I don’t doubt that and that’s the last thing I want.  We barely had enough power to micro jump to where we currently are.”**  


He thought about where she said to go for a safe harbor.   Memories came back to him.   Memories of the Chu’unthor II.   A Jedi praxium ship that was his home for a short time before and after Order 66.  It held orbit in the Bespin system.   The ship itself was a safe harbor but it was no longer there.   


**”Cloud city, Bespin.  I’m familiar.   It’s been almost twenty years since I was last there.”**  He saw the determined look on her face and decided to try a different approach.  He brought his hands up and removed his helmet.   His dark eyes now looked upon the young woman.  **”Eve, do you need to full ten hours to have sufficient power for a jump to Bespin?”**

**"Negative,"** Eve replies instantly. **"Minimum power for a single hyperdrive jump to a system of Bespin's proximity can be achieved in approximately four standard hours at current recharge rates. However, arriving with depleted power reserves would leave the *Venture* tactically vulnerable upon entry. All non-essential systems, including shields and weapon capacitors, would remain offline."**

Nadia's focus narrows on Wes as he removes his helmet. She sees the face of a man no older than his late twenties, his expression grim and weary. The statement "twenty years ago" hangs in the air, a stark, chronological impossibility. A flicker of deep, profound confusion crosses her features, a new mystery piling onto the mountain of trauma she is already trying to process. She files it away, another piece of the puzzle that doesn't fit.

**"Four hours,"** she repeats, latching onto the critical piece of information. Her voice is stronger now, honed by the tactical problem in front of her. **"That's still a long time. But it's better than ten."**

She looks from Wes to Varda, her gaze insistent. **"We can't afford to be a vulnerable target. But we can't afford to sit here and wait for an Imperial patrol to stumble upon us either. Four hours. We leave the second we have enough power for the jump. Not a minute longer."**

Wes noticed her eyes scrutinize his face when he removed his helmet.   It was as if she was trying to reference something.   It was the same feeling when she looked at his armor and Clan Sigil.  A thought had begun to enter his mind but it went away quickly when she started to give orders as to when they would leave.  He raised an eyebrow as his head turned ever so slightly. 


**”No.”**  He said flatly.   **”I understand that you want to get to Bespin, to your uncle and to Clan Skirita.  It’s safe there for you and you can take care of your friend but we also have a situation here.”**  He tucked his helmet under his left arm like it was second nature.  **”The five of us just woke up here about twelve hours ago from an extended cryo sleep.  Only nine years or so for myself but hundreds for others.  We are also trying to figure out things like what the hell happened and why we were put into cryo.  So understand if we don’t just jump at your orders to leave in four hours.”**

Nadia flinches as if struck by his flat refusal. The fragile shell of command she had tried to build shatters instantly. Her shoulders slump, and the determined light in her eyes gutters and dies, replaced once again by that haunted, distant look.

**"I... I wasn't giving orders,"** she whispers, her voice shrinking back to the brittle rasp from before. She hugs her arms around herself, a subconscious gesture of self-protection. **"I just... thought..."**

Her words trail off as the rest of his statement lands. *Hundreds of years.* Her eyes widen, a fresh wave of shock and disbelief washing over her face. She stares at him, then at Varda, as if seeing them for the first time not as rescuers, but as impossible, living ghosts. The implications are too vast, too complex for her fractured mind to fully process. It is another layer of impossibility piled upon an already unbearable reality. She says nothing more and simply retreats back into a silent, watchful stillness.

Wes saw her shrink away as he spoke and he realized that even though his words weren’t harsh she had just come from an ordeal where her captors had been cruel and most likely beat her when she spoke up.  


He let out a sigh as she shrunk away.  The proud fierce Mandalorian woman that was beginning to show had retreated back to the captive woman they had found.  The gravity of his words seems to only half register.   If he wasn’t living it he would have a hard time believing and understanding it himself.


Slowly and calmly he stepped forward.  || **”Sister,”** || He said gently in Mandalorian before switching to Basic.  **”I apologize, I know you’ve been through a horrifying experience only to wake up on a strange ship with strangers.”**  Within the Force he let his presence gently reach out to her.  Not to overpower but to reassure that she was safe.  **”Bespin isn’t far and it sounds like the best place for us to go.  Our options are limited.   Perhaps the Force put us all together to help each other.  The *Venture* needs some time to power up.  According to Eve we don’t need a full ten hours but we will need more than four to be safe.  Arriving with no power and crashing or spinning out of control will help no one.”** 


He realized he was throwing a lot at her and took a step back. **”You’re probably hungry.  There isn’t much for food but there is nutrient paste.  It’s fairly bland but it will be good for you.  How does that sound?”**  He waited for an answer to see if she would come back out of the protective shell.

“**I’m glad you’re having a good time,”** said Iyola.  Vaeros was a puzzle to her.  He must have had a hard life, and was clearly a battle-tested warrior. *That scar was no joke.* Being a Jedi in this era was apparently different than it had been in her time. Yet at the same time he seemed sweet, maybe sheltered, in a way.  *It was odd. * He also kept avoiding her questions about how long he’d been frozen.  Maybe he didn’t know, or didn’t want to think about it. 

**“So these are the last two we place,” **she said.  **“This,”** she indicated a large reptilian chomping its jaws,** ‘is the Mantellian Savrip. It’s really strong and will take out even the few pieces that have high defense in one blow.  And this is the Houjix.  If it takes out a piece, it can move again.  So go ahead and choose your piece and place it.  The Savrip, I like to think of actually as more of a defender, and the Houjix benefits from mobility, so think about that when you choose your starting square.”  **Really, she should have chosen again, but she was trying to make it easy on  Vaeros.  **“Once we place, we begin. I’ll let you start. This can just be a learning game so don’t worry too much about it.  We won’t wager unless you want to.”**

**“Oh, I should have mentioned this draft variant.  You might have noticed that we didn’t place the Scrimp,” **she said, pointing to an odd eyeless tentacle-beast, **“and the Karkath.  In Spira Draft, once the first piece is lost, the game automatically puts in one of those last  two pieces in a random space.  You don’t choose which one.  Same with the second piece.  Make sense?” **

**“You can go first,” **Iyola generously offered. In the background projection, a pink-hued nonapod wriggled its way across the screen.

Varda straightness, leaning on her own weight fully. The two fiece sensitives no doubt see her expand in the force. She stretches thin. Her form reaching out into space. Her presence like stormy clouds unfurl. Then like lightning something flows back. in arcs of  awareness in her own presence. She pulls back In just as they feel a darkness inside of her recoil and lash out In anger. 

Outwardly their is a tightening of her eyes and her back goes ramrod straight. After a few moments she lets the tension melt away. "**Your fears Nadia Skiratta are not unfounded.

The medbay falls silent again, the air thick with unspoken histories and fresh grief. Nadia remains curled on herself.

Wes's apology, delivered in a gentle Basic after the familiar comfort of Mando'a, is a soft knock on the door of her fortress. She doesn't open it, but she hears it. The tension in her shoulders lessens by a fraction. His logic about the ship's power is sound; the trained part of her mind, the part that understands mission parameters and risk assessment, acknowledges the truth in his words, even if her raw survival instinct still screams to flee.

Then comes Varda's vision.

For Nadia, whose own senses are a raw, open wound, it's an overwhelming event. She flinches as she feels the old woman's presence swell, a sudden storm of power that fills the room, followed by the terrifying, jagged recoil of that *other*, broken thing Varda carries within her. It's a frightening display, but it is followed by a statement of absolute, preternatural certainty: *We will be safe*.

Coming from a Force-user of such obvious power, the words land with the weight of prophecy. It's the first solid thing Nadia has had to hold onto since waking up. She looks up first and Varda and then to Wes, her gaze traveling to his face. The fear of immediate discovery, which had been a driving, frantic terror, is now countered by Varda's assurance. The tactical risk of waiting has been weighed against the tactical risk of arriving helpless.

The offer of food is a simple, tangible act of care, a thing so normal it's almost alien to her now. She gives a single, small, almost imperceptible nod. **"Okay,"** she whispers, the word barely audible.

She slowly, carefully, pushes herself off the diagnostic bed. Her bare feet touch the cold deck plating, and for a moment, she wavers, a tremor running through her gaunt frame. The sterile, grey smock she wears offers no warmth and little dignity. It's a shapeless, threadbare garment, stained and ripped at the shoulder, hanging loosely on her. It ends just above her knees, leaving her thin legs and arms exposed, a stark canvas for the faint, mottled roadmap of bruises left by her captors.

### **Nadia Skirata** (08/11/2025 21:31:20) <br style='clear: both;'>

*1404577956071997471*

Nadia flinches slightly at the offered hand, a purely reflexive motion, but she doesn't pull away. Her gaze drops to the simple, grey fatigues resting on the nearby tray, then back to the threadbare smock she's wearing. A flicker of something—shame, perhaps, or just a desperate need for a scrap of normalcy—crosses her face.

She looks at Varda, her eyes conveying a silent, weary gratitude. She gives another small nod and, with a trembling hand, reaches for the folded clothes, her movements still slow and uncertain. The offer of help, of a moment of privacy, is a kindness she had forgotten existed.

Nadia's trembling fingers close around the folded grey fatigues. The fabric is rough, simple, but clean. It is the most normal thing she has touched in weeks. She gives Varda a single, sharp nod of gratitude, a silent acceptance of the offer for privacy. Her eyes find one of the medbay's small, partitioned sanitation units, and she moves toward it, her steps still unsteady but now filled with a quiet, desperate purpose.

A few minutes later, she emerges. The transformation is subtle, but profound. The prisoner's smock is gone, and with it, some of the raw, exposed vulnerability she carried. The simple, grey shipboard fatigues, though loose on her gaunt frame, provide a layer of anonymity, of psychological armor. Her posture is a fraction straighter, her expression still haunted, but the abject terror has been replaced by a carefully constructed wall of stoic neutrality.

She walks back to where Wes and Varda are waiting, her bare feet silent on the cold deck plating. She stops before Wes, her gaze meeting his, now clear and unnervingly direct.

**"The galley,"** she says, her voice still a low rasp, but now it is a statement of intent, not a question. **"You offered food."**

### **Wes Del-Fin** (08/11/2025 23:24:52) <br style='clear: both;'>

*1404606527494684685*

Wes felt the build up within the Force as Varda gathered he will in an amazing display.  The old woman, while not physically strong, was someone to be mindful of.   When she comes back saying that they will be safe for the ten hours it was enough for Nadia to finally relax.   As she looked from Vaeda and back to him the feeling once again needles at him.   It was as if she was looking at him and through him at the same time.  She said okay when food. Was mentioned but she still didn’t seem to be present in the moment.   


Varda’s mention of her changing her clothes seemed to bring her out of it.  The idea of leaving the horrible identity of a captive behind seems to give her a little motivation.   When she moved off to one of the partitions he turned and looked at Varda.  He looked at the old woman with a new respect.  **”Thank you.   I’m not sure I could have gotten her to go along.   Can’t say I blame her.  Still though,”**  He spoke softly as he looked to where she disappeared behind the partition.  **”The way she looks at me I feel like she knows something.   Maybe it has to do with Clan Del-Fin.”**  He shook his head knowing now wasn’t the time to ask.   


When Nadia came back out he noticed the subtle differences.  How she moved.  How she stood.  How she presented herself.   It wasn’t leaps and bounds but it was a few small steps in the right direction.  She once again looked between the two of them and her gaze fell upon him once more as he mentioned the galley and food.  **”Yes I did.  It’s only nutrient paste but it will do the job for now.”**  He looked down at her bare feel and raised an eyebrow.  **”Not that you can’t walk around barefoot but we did secure your equipment chest when we left the *Aether.* Perhaps there is something there you can wear?  Then food.”**  He gave her a small smile as he let her think about it.

*1404610743550349352*

Nadia looks down at her bare feet on the cold deck plating, a flicker of a wry smile, touching her lips for a fraction of a second as she wiggles her toes. It's the first hint of her old self, a ghost of who she was.

But the mention of her equipment chest shatters the moment.

Instinctively, her hand flies to her throat, her fingers scrabbling for the cold metal of the collar that is no longer there. Her breath catches, her eyes widening with a fresh wave of panic. The memory of the trap, the relay, the knowledge that her own possessions were turned into a weapon against her, comes rushing back.

For a long, tense second, she stands frozen, her hand clutching her neck, her mind caught between the desire for the safety of her armor and the terror of the trap it represents.

Then, slowly, her fingers uncurl. She touches the chafed, raw skin of her throat. It's real. The collar is gone. The fear is still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it is now overlaid with a cold, pragmatic calculation. **"Yes,"** she says, her voice low but steady, the decision made. **"My gear. Then food."**

*1404675037880914036*

Wes smiled when he saw the smile as she wiggled her toes on the sterile deck plating.  Yet when it registered that he mentioned her equipment chest everything changed.   He felt the spike of fear and panic as she clutched at her throat.  **”Nadia!”** He said softly with a sense of urgency in an attempt to reach through the fear.   It did nothing as her hands clutched at her neck only to find the collar gone.   All that remained was the bruising and emotional scars that he knew would remain long after the physical ones had healed.   


He stood there as she fought her inner demons knowing that she needed to do this on her own.   Instead of interfering he stood guard as if protecting her from any and all things that would harm her.  Seconds ticked by and her fingers uncurled from her neck as she once again rooted herself.  Her voice now low but steady agreed.   Her gear then food.   


He gave her a nod.  **”Gear then food.”**  He gave her a smile as he motioned for them to fall in beside him as he led Nadia to her equipment locker and perhaps a small sense of relief.

### **Storyteller** (08/12/2025 08:06:41) <br style='clear: both;'>

*1404737847335977040*

Wes leads the way out of the medbay, Varda and Nadia falling in step beside him. They move through the now fully-lit, sterile corridors of the *Venture*, a silent trio heading back toward the airlock antechamber where the rescued chest awaits.

The journey is short. As they arrive, the heavy durasteel chest sits where Iyola and Dryzan left it, an imposing, silent object in the middle of the floor. Its presence is a stark reminder of their violent escape and the dangers they faced.

Nadia stops a few paces from it, her gaze fixed on the Rekr sigil etched into its surface. The memory of the trap, of her own gear being turned into a potential instrument of her torture, is a palpable weight in the air. She looks from the chest to Wes, a silent, unspoken question in her eyes. It is not just a box of equipment; it is a final test, a final barrier between her and reclaiming a piece of herself.

### **Nadia Skirata** (08/12/2025 08:07:08) <br style='clear: both;'>

*1404737961773240391*

Nadia takes a slow, deliberate breath, her gaze locked on the chest. The fear is still there, a cold coiling in her gut, but beneath it, something else is stirring—a flicker of defiance, a spark of the warrior she used to be. She will not be a victim. Not anymore.

She walks forward, her steps steady, and kneels before the heavy container. Her fingers, still trembling slightly, trace the outline of the snarling Rekr wolf on the lid, a moment of silent connection to her clan, to her family.

Then, with a final, steadying breath, she reaches for the latch. She doesn't hesitate. She doesn't flinch. She simply acts.

There is a soft, metallic *click* as the lock disengages. No explosion. No jolt of electricity. No signal to a madman. Only the quiet, mundane sound of a box being opened.

She lifts the heavy lid. Inside, nestled in the dark interior, is the familiar, comforting sight of her black and blue Mandalorian armor. It is her identity, her strength, her past and her future, all waiting for her. A single, heavy tear of pure, unadulterated relief rolls down her cheek and splashes onto the beskar. She is no longer just a victim. She is a Mandalorian again.

### **Nadia Skirata** (08/12/2025 08:07:11) <br style='clear: both;'>

*1404737972619706430*

With the immediate danger passed, Nadia's movements become methodical, focused. She pushes aside the folded sections of her beskar armor—the pauldrons, the chest plate, the vambraces—her hands moving with a practiced familiarity. She is taking a silent, mental inventory, ensuring every piece is where it should be.

She gently shifts a small, neatly folded pile of dark grey fatigues and a compact tool kit to one side. It is Derek's gear. She pauses for a fraction of a second, her hand resting on the fabric, a flicker of pain crossing her face before she walls it off again, her expression returning to a stoic mask.

Her search seems to be for something specific. She retrieves a pair of sturdy, knee-high combat boots and a pair of thick, woolen stockings, setting them beside her on the deck. She is still not satisfied. Her hands continue to rummage through the chest, moving past pouches of energy cells and a holstered blaster pistol.

Then, her fingers close around it. She pulls out a simple, cylindrical object. It is a lightsaber hilt, crafted from unadorned, practical durasteel, its grip wrapped in worn, dark synth-cord. It is not a flashy or elegant weapon; it is a tool, built for function, not for show. She holds it for a moment, its familiar weight a solid, comforting presence in her hand, before carefully clipping it to the utility belt that is already part of the fatigues she wears.

### **Wes Del-Fin** (08/12/2025 11:13:12) <br style='clear: both;'>

*1404784784395337789*

Wes watched as he saw Nadia face her fears.   Her gear box held her life inside it.   Her identity.   This was more than facing it and opening it after her ordeal.   It was her claiming herself once more.   Claiming who and what she was.   


Mandalorian.


When he felt the relief flow off of her he looked over at Varda and nodded.  She had taken another step on her recovery.    There was silence in the airlock antechamber.   Muted noises came from the box as she rummaged through it.  A pair of high boots and stockings found their way to the floor.   After that she pulled out one more object.   It was functional more than elegant and flashy like many he saw during the war.  This was meant to be used and respected.  When she clipped it to the belt he gave her a nod and knew that this was the time to tell her about one of the others on board.  Better to know ahead of time then to be surprised and taken unaware.   


**”Nadia there is one on board who was in cryo like the rest of us.”**  He paused for a second.   **”Im sure we were all out in there for a reason.  Surely no one here knows why.  He’s a Fallen Jedi.  He fought alongside myself, Varda and the others to free you from *Aether*.”**  Wes chose the word fallen over dark for obvious reasons.  After the fall there was lots of grey in the galaxy.   As for Vaeros he still hadn’t made up his mind yet but he did help rescue Nadia, Misha and recover Derek.

*1404788996319612928*

Varda takes the time walking from the medbay to the airlock antechamber to observe. Watching how Nadia slowly comes into herself but also builds walls. How she seems to be reclaiming small parts of her identity. Small but necessary steps. "**Perhaps reservations can be made on him till we learn what he is like as a person. Not merely who he is when bound by duties and obligations.**" 

She leans slightly on her staff taking a moment to recover her breathe from dealing with the assault at her spirit. She smooths the edges. "**You all seem to use these weapons.**" she chuckles sligbtly. "**I feel I may have missed the requirement on the invitation**"

*1404799810527170713*

Nadia pauses in the act of pulling on her boots, her head tilting slightly as Wes speaks. The words "Fallen Jedi" hang in the air, a term laden with a thousand different meanings—tragedy, betrayal, danger. She looks up at Wes, her expression unreadable, and then her gaze drifts to the lightsaber hilt still clipped to his belt and then at her own belt. She says nothing, but a flicker of understanding, of a shared and complicated history, passes through her eyes.

She finishes pulling on her second boot, the solid thud as it hits the deck plating a sound of finality. She stands, the simple act of being properly shod a small but significant step in reclaiming herself. She looks at Varda, a faint, almost imperceptible smile touching her lips at the old woman's dry wit.

**"Perhaps the invitation was lost,"** she says, her voice still a low rasp, but with the first hint of dry humor.

*1404799819989651516*

The fleeting moment of humor passes as quickly as it came, her expression growing serious once more. Her hand unconsciously drifts to the cool metal of her own lightsaber hilt, a grounding, familiar gesture. She looks from Wes's armored form to Varda's ancient, knowing eyes, her mind piecing together the impossible things they've told her.

**"You need to be careful,"** she says, her voice low and grave. **"Both of you. The galaxy you remember... it's gone."**

Her gaze becomes distant, as if reciting a grim history lesson she has learned firsthand.

**"The first decade after the Empire rose... it was a purge. The Jedi weren't just defeated; they were systematically hunted, vilified, and exterminated. To the Core Worlds, they're boogeymen now, traitors from a history book written by the victors. Anyone showing even a hint of sensitivity is a target—for Inquisitors, for bounty hunters, for anyone looking to curry favor with the Empire."**

She lets out a slow, weary breath.

**"Out here, on the fringes... people have longer memories and shorter loyalties. They might not bat an eye if you ignite one of these,"** she gestures to their weapons, **"as long as it's on their side of a fight. But the closer you get to civilized space, the more a lightsaber stops being a symbol of a peacekeeper and becomes a beacon. A target. A death sentence."**

She looks at them both, her eyes filled with a grim, weary warning. **"It is not a weapon to be drawn lightly."**

*1404829346023080086*

Wes caught the unspoken look Nadia gave him when he mentioned the Dark Jedi that was also aboard.   He considered telling her what Valero’s was but when Varda mentioned about judging the man for who he is now and not who he was he simply gave her a nod.  He looked back at Nadia and nodded again.  The same look with a feeling of caution he sent out to both of the women.  


As Nadia stood he saw a change in her.  The act of claiming her heritage and who she was did more for her than anything else he could think of.    Her quip about Varda’s invite being lost when it came to a lightsaber brought a wry smile to his face.  Her humor reminded him of Marina and the thought caused it to fall slightly.   A small bit of regret rose up within him as he remembered how he couldn’t sense her.   


As Nadia started to speak again he dealt with the feeling and listened as she stated the current state of affairs in the galaxy.   Only being nine years removed it was still pretty much the same.  The Empire ruled with an iron grip.  Any and all things Jedi related was dealt with quickly and with no consequences for anyone involved.

He nodded when she said that their weapons were not ones to be drawn lightly.  **”I lived through the Purge.  My ability wasn’t discovered until I was almost seventeen.   It was about five months before Order 66.”**  He thought back to the day when he left for the Chu’unthor II.  Master Silas had thought it best that the two of them were separated.  **”After that fateful mission I was sent to train with the Altisian Jedi who were based out of Bespin.  Order 66 happened a couple months after that.   I was on the run for years.   Separated from loved ones and Clan in an effort to protect them.  I knew my presence would be a danger to them all”**  He looked at Varda knowing that she had heard some of this before.  **”I came back from the outer regions and decided to help.  I had a ship and got caught up with a group that helped people and families get out from under the Empire.”**  


He looked at Nadia hoping that she understood that he had some idea of what was out there if they weren’t careful.  **”There was a fledgling resistance then.  Did it ever take off?”**

Nadia listens, her expression a mask of intense focus, absorbing his story. The mention of the Altisian Jedi, of Bespin, of helping people escape—it all paints a picture that aligns with her own fragmented, chaotic experiences of the last decade. It confirms the grim reality she has lived.

**"The resistance..."** she repeats, the word tasting strange on her tongue. **"It's more than fledgling now. It's real. They call themselves the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Rebel Alliance."**

She shifts her weight, her voice taking on the tone of someone reciting battlefield intelligence.

**"They're not just scattered cells anymore. They have fleets, organized command structures. They've won victories—small ones, but significant. They've bloodied the Empire's nose enough that the Emperor takes them seriously. He's diverted entire sector fleets to hunt them down. It's a real war now. Desperate, bloody, fought in the shadows and the forgotten corners of the galaxy. Every day, the Empire's grip gets tighter, and every day, the Alliance finds a new way to slip through their fingers. It's the only real hope there is."**

Varda shifts on her feet, content to listen and gather as much information on this time as she can. "**Well it's been a pleasure talking yo you both. I'm going to do what old women do best and go gossip with the other members of the crew.**"

She pauses to look at Nadia. "**If you need someone to sit with, to merely be in the presence of I'm always free.**"

She then gives the two a final warm smile and toddles down the corridor

Vaeros nods, **"Yeah, you're much more different than what meets the eye. Words are not my niche, but your explanations do make sense. I'll use the Houjix."** He moves the piece on the board and looks back at Iyola. *I don't really understand this, but shes passionate about it, so I suppose it makes up for it. I don't think that I would reach out for these kinds of games, but it's nice, I guess.*

**"I think I have some of these gems from when I woke up, so I'll wager one of them for you. Oh, I don't think I specified my time period before I woke up, did I? I last recall being in the 4th year of the Empire, or about 200 or so years from your time. **" Vaeros grabs a gem from his pouch and sets it to the side.

The door to the recreation room slides open, the soft hiss as it slides against the metal enough to alert the others in the room. The form of varda stands at the entryway. She smiles as she sees the other two. She makes her way into the room and finds a place to sit near the board that enables her to watch what's happening. "**Ahh don't mind me. Just thought I'd pop by to say hello.**"  

She goes into one of her numerous pouches and pulls our a small whittling knife and a  block or wood, She goes about marking places as she watches the other two engage in the game.

*1404930983031214202*

Iyola’s eyes widened slightly. It sounded like Vaeros had responded to what she’d been *thinking* about him.  That wasn’t so surprising, she supposed; Jedi were known to be able to hear thoughts.  *I can easily test that theory later. *

**“Now you’ve made me curious,”**  Iyola said.  **“What you thought I’d be like, and what you think I’m like.  You’ve got to tell me.”**  She placed the Savrip four lateral squares from the Bulbous, its scaly bulk now tinted green. 

**“I’m still a bit confused when it comes to this new year system,” **she confessed. **“You’re from (30 bby)?  Or maybe (25bby?) Is that right?”**

She glanced down at his gem, twinkling in the shifting light of the dejarik holoprojection. It was pretty enough, but credits had never been her motivation.  **“Tell you what,”** she said. **“You’re a researcher, you like to know things, right?  I like to find things out too.  Forget the gems. Let’s wager information.  If I win, I ask you a question and you have to answer.  Same for me.” ** She smiled winningly.  **“Sounds good?”**

She looked up as Varda entered the room.  **“Oh, hi Varda,”** she said.  **“Vaeros and I are about to play dejarik, the Spira Draft variant, if you know it. It’s his first game of dejarik ever!’ **

Iyola folded her hands together as she examined the distribution of the pieces.  Already, the holograms were snapping and straining and wriggling, eager to enter combat.  She lifted her head and looked him directly in the eye.  **“Your move,”** she said.

Wes listened as Nadia spoke.   Hearing how the resistance had grown in the last nine years was surprisingly unexpected.    The cells were an unorganized mess of missmashed groups.  If they were becoming a cohesive fighting group that meant they got some real leadership.  He had many questions but now wasn’t the time.   He had promised her food and then meant the galley and then maybe the red room where Iyola and Vaeros had gone.   


As if his mind was being read Varda excused herself.   Mentioning joining the others and offering Nadia an ear if needed.    Wes nodded.  **“Thanks for helping me, Varda.   We’ll join you in the rec area soon.”**  


As Varda left the airlock antechamber Wes turned for the galley.   **”The galley is this way.”** As they strode out into the corridor he had much he wanted to ask but kept it contained for the moment.   **”Do you want to get a message out to anyone?  Anyone who may be looking for you?”**

*1404986225927913526*

Nadia falls into step beside Wes, her new boots making a soft, steady rhythm on the deck plating. She moves with a purpose that wasn't there before, the simple act of reclaiming her gear and sharing intelligence having rekindled a small, steady flame within her.

At his question, the flame flickers. A shadow passes over her features, and she is quiet for several long strides, the silence filled only by the hum of the ship. She can feel his unspoken curiosity, a dozen questions humming just beneath the surface of his calm demeanor. It's not an aggressive probe, but it's there—a pressure, an expectation.

**"No,"** she says finally, her voice low and flat, her gaze fixed on the corridor ahead. **"Everyone who would be looking for me... thinks I'm dead."**

She lets the stark finality of that statement hang in the air for a moment, a wall to stop the questions she can feel him wanting to ask. After another few steps, she lets out a slow, weary sigh, as if deciding to offer a partial explanation.

**"The only ones who would care are on Bespin,"** she clarifies, her tone still guarded. **"I can't risk an open transmission from a ghost ship like this. It's better to send a secure message once we're in-system, through channels I trust. I've been gone for weeks. A few more days to do this right... it won't change anything."**

Her words effectively close the door on the topic, framing her silence not as secrecy, but as a grim, pragmatic necessity.

*1404986273021820958*

Wes leads Nadia into the galley. The utilitarian space is empty and silent, save for the low hum of the nutrient dispensers. For Nadia, stepping into the room is a stark, almost physical shock. After two weeks in a cramped, filthy cell, the sheer *openness* of the space is disorienting. Her gaze sweeps across the room, taking in the clean metal tables, the ordered dispensers, and, finally, the massive viewport that dominates the far wall.

She stops dead, her breath catching in her throat.

Through the viewport, the unfiltered light of the Kinooine sun blazes, a colossal, brilliant sphere of white-gold fire hanging in the infinite blackness. It is a view of overwhelming scale, of silent, terrifying, beautiful majesty. For someone whose entire world has been four metal walls, the sudden, violent reminder of the sheer size of the galaxy is a staggering blow.

She says nothing, but she slowly walks toward the viewport, drawn by the light. She stops a few feet away, her reflection a small, wavering silhouette against the stellar fire, looking like a lost soul who has just stumbled upon the face of a god.

Wes raised an eyebrow at her statement wondering what the situation was.  He didn’t mention anything about the feeling of familiarity he felt when he first saw and sensed her.   He had already brushed it off as a fluke.   As it was he couldn’t recall having met anyone her age before he was put into cryo.    When she explained a bit more he nodded as it made sense.  


He was about to ask a question when they entered the galley but he held back when he saw her take in the view of the open space.   Then she looked out the view port.  He had to admit that the view outside was impressive.  As the quiet continued he decided it was time to ask another question.     


**”I'm going to assume that you will message a Ghurn Skirita when we get in system?”**  He saw her head turn towards him and he knew  he owed her an explanation for knowing about this Ghurn.  He held up a hand to hold off and snap questions.   **”Eve seems to have quite the extensive database.  Seeing. Your clan sigil on your equipment chest I took a leap and asked Eve if there was any publicly available information on the Skirita.    I knew of them during the war but never had any interactions with them.”**

Nadia's head snaps toward him, her reverie shattered. A look of sharp, profound suspicion flashes across her face. The brief moment of awe is gone, replaced by the wary, analytical gaze.

**"I never gave you his name,"** she says, her voice low and dangerously quiet. The grief has been momentarily replaced by a cold, protective fire.

She watches his explanation, her expression unreadable as he mentions Eve and the clan sigil. The visible tension in her shoulders eases slightly when she realizes it was the ship's AI, not some unknown mental power, that provided the name. The logic is sound, but the result is the same: he knows a name she did not offer.

**"The Coursers,"** she says, the words a flat statement of fact. **"Eve found the public record for Kando's Coursers."** She turns back to the viewport, her reflection a stark silhouette against the star. **"Yes. He's my uncle... He'll be the one I'll contact."**

Vaeros scratches his scar, **"Well, you seem like a happy-go-lucky bounty hunter, or explorer. You have this uncanny ability to sneak up on me, though, so I suppose it checks out for you."** He responded to the Bulbous by shifting his Houjix.

**"I believe I would be born around (36 BBY), which was used by the Republic. Upon the formation of the Galactic Empire, the 'Before the formation of the Empire' and the 'after the formation of the Empire' were introduced. So I would be born at about 17 BFE, but I went into my sleep at around 4 AFE."**

Vaeros' eyes partially widen,** "You want information, instead of wealth? You most definitely are an explorer, then."** He pauses before speaking,** "Sure, I'll accept your wager."** He smiles, *I don't think I want to win, so I'll play along, I suppose. I'm more interested in what she considers infomation.* 

He glances at Varda and nods, but his mind is on the Board. He has a game to lose.

Wes sighed when he realized he took it a bit too far in mentioning Ghurn.   He wasn’t trying to surprise her but now wasn’t the time for any ‘gotcha’ situations.   


**”Yes.   Klando’s Coursers.  I was trying to find out more.   You weren’t in a state of reliable consciousness and we needed some info that we could use.  If Eve had said it was required to keep you in cryo to progress your healing for an extended time I was going to suggest to the others we head for Bespin to bring you there.”** 


He walked to the water dispenser and filled a cup.   **”If I can’t have some sort of trust in another Mandalorian then things are even worse than before.”**  He gave her a smile when she turned her head.   **”One thing to note, Eve did not know Hhurn was your uncle.”**

Nadia watches his reflection in the viewport, listening to his explanation. The logic is sound, if a little unnerving. Her expression remains a careful mask of neutrality, but the cold fire in her eyes softens. The mention of trust, of the bond between Mandalorians, strikes a chord. It is a language she understands better than anything else.

She turns away from the star to face him fully, leaning back against the cool surface of the viewport.

**"Trust is earned,"** she says, her voice quiet but firm, a statement of Mandalorian creed. **"You have... started well."** It is the closest thing to an admission of gratitude she can offer.

A long silence stretches between them, filled only by the low hum of the ship.

**"He's not my uncle by blood,"** she offers, the words a small, carefully chosen olive branch. **"He and his brother, Storn... they took my mother in when she had nowhere else to go. They raised me and my sister as their own. Ghurn... he is family."** The word 'family' is spoken with a profound, almost reverent weight, the single most important concept in her shattered world.

Wes nodded at her words of trust.  **”Agreed trust is earned.”**  He refilled his cup and walked to a nearby table near the viewport.   He wasn’t going to push her to talk.   She had to do it on her own.   They had to lay the groundwork for the trust to take hold.   


It wasn't long when she turned and leaned against the viewport and started talking.   He listened as she talked about Ghurn and his brother took her mother into the clan and accepted her and her sister.   He nodded.   **”Family is more than just blood.  It’s forged by commitment and trust and it can happen when you’re not even expecting it.”**  


He thought of Fakir and how his family circle expanded by two.  Marina and the child she had not long before they met.   While he never met her daughter or even knew her name, he sensed her when Marina gave him his first test in the Force.   She was still an infant secreted away somewhere safe.  The memory stirred emotions that were long put away so they couldn’t be used against him.   


He took a small drink and let out a quiet sigh.  **”It”s good you three found a place to belong.  A safe place.  The Skirita have a long history.  One that is good and honorable.”**

Nadia gives a single, sharp nod in acknowledgment of his words, a shared understanding of a core Mandalorian truth. Hearing the name of her clan spoken with respect by another Mandalorian is a small, steadying comfort.

She pushes herself away from the viewport and crosses to the nutrient dispensers. With a quiet hum, the machine extrudes a portion of the bland, beige paste onto a tray. She takes it, along with a cup of water, and walks over to the table where Wes is sitting. She doesn't sit directly across from him, but takes a seat at a ninety-degree angle, a position that is both conversational and allows her a clear line of sight to the galley's entrance. It is the careful, ingrained habit of someone who never sits with their back to a door.

She eats a small portion of the paste, her movements slow and deliberate, before setting the utensil down.

**"You wear the sigil of Clan Del-Fin,"** she states, her voice quiet. It is not a question. **"I thought... I was taught they were all lost. On Raxus Prime, during the Purge."**

*1405143675641532467*

He waited as she got some of the nutrient paste from the dispenser.  Her movements were all deliberate, cautious.   She was still unfamiliar with the *Venture.*  They all were if he had to be honest.  In his time spent across the galaxy he had never seen a ship like her.  


She took a seat to his right and he admired her thinking.  It was practical and tactical, allowing her to talk freely while keeping an eye on the galley’s entrance.   She ate in silence and he let her, knowing that when she was ready she’d talk more.  He was looking at his bracer checking on the ships status when he heard the *clink* of the utensil on the plate.   Looking up he could see the look in her eyes as she asked about the Clan Sigil he wore.  Clan Del-Fin.  There was a bit of a surprised look on his face when she mentioned Raxus Prime.  His father and the clan were there on a covert mission when Order 66 was initiated.  Not many knew they were there and he wondered how she knew.   


He gave her a nod.  **”Yes, I wear the Sigil proudly.  I was born into the clan.”**  He paused, taking a drink of his water.  Being asked about the Del-Fin made him wonder about his father and if the man was still alive.  Even though his father wasn’t Force sensitive he always figured he’d know if his dad had died.   Yet being in cryo for nine years so much could have happened.  **”They were on Raxus Prime.  Providing covert combat support at the beginning of the fall.   I was with the Altisian Jedi when it all started.  A small group of us were on New Holstice at the Jedi Memorial when the clones turned.”**  He shook his head at the memory.  Sadness for what transpired and taking the first shot in defense of himself and fellow students and younglings.

**”I wanted to go to them. But I was told to stay away to keep myself safe.  It was the hardest order he had ever given me and it was the hardest order to follow.”   He looked out the view port.  A solar flare was stretching out from the sun.  It was a beautiful display of light and power.   Eventually I heard they did manage to break through the blockade but the losses were heavy and they were going to ground.  Separated and unorganized.   They escaped but were broken.  I knew if I went to them I would just lead the Empire to them and in their current state,”**  He shook his head.  **”So I followed orders.  When your father gives you orders you listen.  Despite how you feel.   In the end he was right.   I had a mark on my head.  I would have led the Empire right to them.”**

Nadia listens intently, her gaze never wavering. The story of a son's duty, of a father's hard command, of the impossible choice between family and survival—it resonates with a deep, painful familiarity. She understands the weight of such orders better than anyone.

When he finishes, she gives a slow, solemn nod of understanding.

**"My mother... gave me a similar order. On Batoon,"** she says, her voice dropping to a near whisper, the name of the world a bitter taste. **"To run. To leave her behind. It was the last order she ever gave me."**

She pushes the memory away before it can take hold, her expression hardening back into a mask of stoic control. She changes the subject, her focus shifting from shared pain to a point of intellectual curiosity.

**"You said the Altisian Jedi. I've only heard the name. My mother's training was... traditional. From the Temple. What was different about them?"**

He watched as she listened.   He was paying attention as if getting a history lesson of something that happened in her lifetime but was too young to remember.   Her nod of understanding told him she was familiar with such situations.  It was a stark reality.  She wasn’t much older than he was when the Republic fell.  The life they led wasn’t an easy one.   


When she spoke of her mother giving her a similar order it resonated within him.   He felt the emotion similar to his at having to make a choice that potentially had a bad outcome no matter the path you took.   You simply had to live with it.   


He felt her reign in her emotions and her face went back to the one of control and not giving anything away.  When she asked about the Altisian Jedi he smiled.   Apparently her mother was trained by the Main Order.  He gave a small chuckle when she asked how they were different.  


He took a breath remembering the first couple months.  **”Their training and ethics were just as strong as the main order but one of the reasons I was sent was that they accepted initiates of any age.  Since I was just turning seventeen when the order made up their mind with what to do with me I didn’t fit the mold of a padawan learner in any way.”**  He smiled when he saw her grin as she was probably imagining a fully armored Mandalorian with younglings.

**”So I was sent to the Altisian Jedi.  Then I found out that they differed even more.  Master Altis didn’t believe in the one master one student ideology.  I trained with many masters, learned different aspects of the force and to look at things differently.”**  He paused as he looked out the viewport once again.  **”But perhaps the biggest difference was the open encouragement of relationships and family within.   It was a stark contrast from the Main Order.”**  He took a sharp inhale and let it out.  The memory of Marina walking down the gangplank was a powerful and lasting memory.  One he still regretted to this day.  That he didn’t fight to let the order keep them together.  To let them both go to the Altisian Sect.  He still believed to this day that bond they shared was the issue.   **”Things would have been different if the Order would have let us go there together but…”** He stopped and shook his head.  He couldn’t change the past.  He looked back to Nadia and saw her watching and listening intently.

Iyola laughed out loud.  **“Bounty hunter? Not me.  I’m more of a catch and release type.”**  She was amused that Vaeros had thought she might have been some kind of hardened mercenary.  *Maybe I look tougher than I think I do.  *

Vaeros’ explanation still didn’t make a lot of sense to Iyola, but she gathered he’d only been asleep about 15 or 20 years. 

She nodded as Vaeros accepted her wager. That would make things more interesting. ** ”In fact, why don’t we up the stakes?  Instead of waiting for the game to be over to ask our questions, we can ask them after the other player loses a piece.”**  She glanced at Vaeros to see if he'd agree.

**“And it’s not that I am so good at sneaking up on people, though I am,”** Iyola continued. **“It’s that you don’t pay attention.  Like now. “ ** She moved the Kintan into her Savrip, bumping it directly into the Houjix.  The green-lit lizard-beast grabbed the Houjix and tore it in half with its powerful jaws.  The Houjix flickered, then disappeared. 

**“Ha!”**  Iyola looked at Vaeros expectantly.  On the far right side of the board, a yellow Kintan shimmered into existence, waving its appendages eagerly.

Nadia's initial interest in the Altisian Jedi's differing philosophies—the acceptance of older students, multiple Masters—is purely academic. It's a curiosity, a filling-in of a gap in her historical knowledge. But as Wes speaks of family, of relationships being openly encouraged, a subtle shift occurs. The wall of stoic neutrality she maintains so carefully develops a hairline fracture.


When he trails off, the weight of his unspoken "but..." hangs heavy in the air. The sudden, sharp spike of his regret, a raw and powerful emotion, cuts through her own carefully constructed defenses. She feels it not as a thought, but as a physical sensation—a sudden, aching pang of profound loss that resonates deep in her own chest. It's not her pain, but it feels hauntingly familiar.


She tilts her head slightly, her gaze analytical but not unkind. **"Us?"** she asks softly, the single word a quiet invitation for him to continue, but with no pressure behind it. She doesn't pry, but she has clearly identified the heart of his pain.

*1405303739270824101*

Wes noticed the subtle shift in her attention as he started talking about the Altisian view on relationships and family.  It seemed to have resonated with her somehow as he spoke his memories of Marina came back with an unwanted reality.  He couldn’t sense her anymore. What had always been a comforting reality, even if they weren’t together, he knew she was alive and well.  Nadia’s question of ‘us’ wasn’t lost on him.  She gave him an opportunity to continue.  While he never really spoke of her to anyone he felt like telling her.  


He nodded.   **”Yes, ‘us’”**  He paused slightly as he sat up a bit straighter.  **”I was sent on a mission to some backwater separatist system to deliver some intel to the republic operative there.  Like always, nothing is ever as it seems and we got mixed up in planetary politics and shady dealings.”**


He took a breath and looked at Nadia. Like before he felt that sense of familiarity and he had no context to understand why.  It was going to eat at him until he figured it out but that wasn’t going to happen right now, If ever.  **”What we didn’t expect or plan for was what happened between us.  Who would have thought a Mandalorian and a Jedi Padawan would fall for each other.”**  He looked Nadia in the eyes and he saw the shade of blue they held.  Something tickled the back of his mind but he dismissed it as he kept talking. **”She opened my eyes and mind to the Force.  Then something else formed and I believe that’s why the Order separated us.”**

His eyes were still looking at her but it seemed as if he was looking through her at something else.  A memory perhaps and he realized the emotions he wasn’t shoring up were spilling out.   Talking about Marina had brought up those strong emotions that were once sufficiently tucked away and he knew she could sense them.   **”We made plans to go back.  To meet back there where we first met. Then Order 66 happened and it all went to hell.”**  There was a hint of anger and frustration in his voice.  His eyes focused once again and she could see that he was looking at her.  **”We never made it back to Fakir and the *Arms Akimbo*.  The cantina where we first met.”**

*1405318160604860547*

Nadia listens, her expression a mask of intense, unreadable focus. She says nothing, her gaze locked on his, absorbing every word. She offers no judgment, no pity, only the silent, steady attention of a fellow soldier hearing a painful after-action report. The names, the places—Fakir, the *Arms Akimbo*—mean nothing to her, but the story is universal. A plan. A promise. A future stolen by the chaos of war and the changes of a galaxy turned against them.

She feels the raw emotions radiating from him—the love, the profound regret, the sharp edge of anger. Her own empathic senses, still raw and open, sting with the intensity of his feelings. It's a painful, disorienting echo. For a fleeting, confusing moment, the image of a woman's face flashes through her mind—brown hair, piercing blue eyes like her own—accompanied by a wave of love and loss so powerful she mistakes it for his, or perhaps her own grief for Derek. She flinches, almost imperceptibly, and subtly erects a mental wall, not to shut him out, but to protect herself from the overwhelming bleed-through of his pain.

She says nothing for a long moment after he finishes, letting the silence of the galley settle around his words.

**"The war... it took from everyone,"** she says finally, her voice a low, somber murmur. It is a simple, profound truth, offered not as comfort, but as a shared acknowledgment of a galaxy built on ruins. She looks at the lightsaber hilt still clipped to his belt, and then down at her own. **"Some of us just have more... reminders than others."**

*1405331130365771886*

Wes fought for control.  Master Rukh, one of his first masters and Master Chase would have scolded him for letting his feelings out like he did.   It may not have been right but it felt good to remember how he felt.   How she made him feel to simply be with her.  With a controlled breath his chest rose and fell and his own defenses were put back into place.  He hadn’t intended to overload her, especially right after going through her own ordeal.   


They sat in silence both taking care with their emotions.  When she did speak her words rang true.   The war took from them all.  For some it took everything, others little.  For the lucky few nothing.  He saw her look at the lightsabers they both carried and spoke of reminders.  He nodded as there was one reminder he always had and now it was gone.  


**”The one reminder that we both shared was the bond that formed between us.  We could always sense her no matter the distance.  From one side of the galaxy to the other.  The distance affected the clarity of what we could sense r but we knew the other was alive.  Still separated by the after effects of the war and then the Empire.”**  


He stood taking a step back and then turned towards the water dispenser.  **”Even Eve with her database of information has nothing on her.  It all ends after Order 66.  I wouldn’t be surprised if she had something to do with that.   Despite her Jedi training she was very technically oriented.”**

Nadia watches him, her expression still carefully neutral, but a flicker of intense, analytical curiosity appears in her eyes at the mention of the bond. A connection that transcended galactic distances. It's a concept of the Force her own limited, fractured training never touched upon. Another piece of a puzzle she doesn't understand.

**"The Empire was thorough,"** she says, her voice a flat, clinical statement. **"They didn't just hunt people. They hunted information. They purged archives, corrupted records, erased histories. If your friend was technically inclined and wanted to disappear from their records, she could have. Assuming she survived the Purge."**

She pushes her own tray of half-eaten nutrient paste away, the bland substance suddenly unappealing.

**"If we're going to Bespin, my uncle's network might have answers Eve doesn't. Kando's Coursers deals in information. Sometimes... they find things that were supposed to stay lost."**

It is a small, pragmatic offering—a potential path forward, a way to steer the conversation away from the raw, open wounds of the past and toward a tangible, future objective.

Wes nodded as she spoke of how the Empire rewrote the histories if not outright tossed them in the bin.  Her comment on if Marina had survived the Purge was maybe the only thing that made him want to smile.  **”She did survive the Purge.   I know she was alive right up until the time where my memory lapses.  I don’t know how I ended up in cryo for nine years or where the healed lightsaber wound on my stomach came from.  Either way the Purge wasn’t her downfall.”**    


The mention of her uncle who also dealt with information as a possible resource made very good sense.  **”I’d appreciate that.  Maybe he could also find my transport and droid.  Though after nine years I’m sure someone else has claimed it by now.”**  Sensing the shift in topic away from high emotions to what might lay ahead He let it fall to the wayside.   


**”How long has your uncle been operating out of Cloud City?”**

*1405385035389075477*

Nadia processes his words—the memory lapse, the unexplained wound—with a practiced, analytical calm, filing them away as more variables in an increasingly impossible equation. She offers no comment on them, her focus zeroing in on the practicalities of the future.

The question seems to catch Nadia off guard, pulling a genuine, un-guarded memory to the surface. **"The Coursers..."** she says, a hint of something—pride, perhaps, or just a memory of a simpler time—touching her voice. **"Ghurn has been operating on Cloud City for just over a decade. It started... as a joke, between him and my mother, I think. An idea they had. They built it up together."**

She looks away, out the viewport at the distant, burning star. **"It was my mother's idea to base it on Bespin, to build a network in a place where no one asks too many questions. She said it was the perfect place to hide in plain sight."** There’s a long pause as she lets her thoughts wander and her gaze unfocuses. **"He's been running it alone for the last two years."**

As Nadia speaks, her voice, which had found a measure of strength and steadiness, begins to waver. A visible tremor runs through her hand as she rests it on the table. The carefully constructed walls she has been erecting since waking are starting to crack under the strain of memory, grief, and the profound, bone-deep exhaustion of her ordeal.

She presses her lips together, fighting for control, but a wave of dizziness washes over her, forcing her to grip the edge of the table to steady herself. Her face, already pale, loses another shade of color.

Wes leaned against the counter where the water dispenser as Nadia talked about Ghurn and her mother and how they started the operation on Cloud City.    **”A decade and still going.   They must be doing something right to still be in operation.”**  She gave a small smile and nodded at his comment continuing without break.
 
 
What she said about Cloud City and Bespin matched up with what he knew of it in the relatively short time he spent there.  He then noticed something.  Maybe he felt something as well as he noticed her voice begin to waver.  Her hand seemed to push against the table as if to steady herself.   He was already pushing off the counter when he saw her color fade as she worked to steady herself.  


Moving quicker than it would seem possible, Wes hurried to the table where they sat.    It either spoke to the craftsmanship of his Beskar’gam or that he wore it like a second skin that he moved as if unencumbered.  **“Hey, stay seated, don't stand up.”**  He said gently yet firmly as he laid a hand on her shoulder.  It was then that it was reaffirmed that she was still weak and needed some rest.   While the talk and food were good, rest was still the priority.

*1405520839297728646*

The sudden movement, the hand on her shoulder—it's too much, too fast. Nadia flinches violently, a sharp, choked gasp escaping her lips as her entire body goes rigid. It's a pure, instinctual reaction, the muscle memory of a captive bracing for a blow.

But the blow doesn't come. The hand on her shoulder is firm, but steady, not cruel. It doesn't shove or grip; it guides. The wave of panic recedes as quickly as it came, leaving behind only the dizzying, profound weakness that caused her to falter.

The strength drains from her legs. She doesn't fight his guidance, but instead allows him to gently push her back down into the chair, slumping into it with a weary sigh. She closes her eyes for a moment, the simple act of sitting an immense relief.

**"I'm... fine,"** she lies, her voice a thin, unconvincing whisper. **"Just... tired."**

Wes felt her flinch when his hand firm yet gentle was placed on her shoulder.  He inwardly cursed at himself realizing that his sudden movement caused her to think she was going to be hit.  When the expected blows did not come and she knew she was safe, he began to guide her back down into the chair.  He felt her relax as she slumped back into the chair.  He smiled at her stubbornness when she proclaimed that she was alright.  


**”Indeed you are tired.  And rest is on the docket for you.  Here,”**  He slid her glass of water over to her so she could take a drink.  **”Take a small drink.  When you’ve had enough, I'll show you where the bunks are and you can claim one that hasn't been taken yet.  Sound good Nadia?”**

**"A standard bunk will provide adequate rest. However, for optimal recovery, I would recommend the subject return to the Medbay. The diagnostic beds are equipped with low-level bio-regulators that can continue to administer passive nutrient support and nanite therapy during a natural sleep cycle. This would be twenty-two percent more efficient for restoring her metabolic and muscular-skeletal deficiencies than unassisted rest."**

Nadia looks from Wes to the empty doorway, then back again. The logical, clinical efficiency of the AI's suggestion is undeniable, but the thought of returning to that sterile, white room, the place where she learned of Derek's death, sends a faint, fresh wave of dread through her.

He was about to urge her again to take a drink but Eve surprisingly spoke up and suggested the diagnostic bed over a bunk.  It made sense for the most practical of reasons.     However when he saw her look from him to the door and back to him once again he felt the wave of dread well up within her.   It took him a few seconds, enough time for him to cock his head to the side in thought.   Then it hit him.  Derek's body would be in the adjacent room.   


He gave her a nod and a reassuring pat on the shoulder.  **”Eve, I think for her psychological wellbeing that Medbay may not be the best choice right now.   I know the concern to monitor and provide nutrient support but she has a way to increase her healing.  She can enter a healing trance and use the Force to help accelerate her healing.”**  Looking at her he could see the relief in her eyes and feel it in the Force.  **”And to make sure she comes along alright she can come to the Medbay when she wakes for a quick checkup and not have to stay an extended amount of time.”**  He didn’t ask if that was acceptable or the best course as that was going to be the plan anyways.   He gave her shoulder a gentle  squeeze making sure not to hurt her to reassure her she’d be alright.   


He wasn’t sure why but he wanted to make sure that she was alright.  The familiarity of something he should know was still there and it was nagging at him.   The idea of talking with her uncle sounded promising.   If he and Nadia, when she felt better, could help him find Marina he be forever thankful.

**"Maybe?"** Vaeros faintly chuckles,  **"That's not reassuring." **

Vaeros briefly turns serious before relaxing his posture.** "Well, I led a remnant of the Separatist Alliance, known also as the Confederacy of Independent Systems. I wanted to continue my search for artifacts, fight the good fight, and do what I thought was best, but that could not last. My remnant flotilla was carved down until all that was left was a smoldering ship. After losing in a duel with Lord Vader, I had two choices: Join or die. I chose the former." **

**"Now, I got this scar during my training as an Inquisitor; a mark of weakness. My skills are needed intact, so I was not stripped of Limbs, like most were."**

**"I suppose it it's my turn now though. Try figuratively beating the rest out of me." **Vaeros smiles, and moves the Yellow Kintan, attacking the Green Kintan.

The wave of dread recedes as quickly as it came, replaced by a quiet, profound sense of relief. She looks up at Wes, her eyes conveying a gratitude that she cannot yet put into words. The simple act of him understanding her unspoken fear, of advocating for her comfort over cold efficiency, is a more potent balm than any nutrient paste.

She takes the offered glass of water, her hand steadier now, and takes a long, slow drink. It is the first decision she has made that feels entirely her own since waking.

After finishing most of the water, Nadia sets the cup down with a soft click. The small act seems to center her. She looks up at Wes, her gaze clear and direct. The exhaustion is still etched on her features, a deep weariness in her bones, but the cornered-animal terror is gone, replaced by a quiet resolve.

**"Thank you,"** she says, the words simple but imbued with a sincere, weary gratitude. **"The barracks. I think... I'm ready."**

She pushes herself to her feet, slowly this time, her movements deliberate and controlled. She is still unsteady, but she does not waver. Leaning only slightly on the table for support, she stands, ready to follow him, ready for the simple, profound relief of a quiet room and a place to rest.

Vaeros’s story is much more involved than Iyola had expected.  It sounds important - and bizarre.  *Confederacy of Independent Systems?  Inquisitor?  Lord Vader?  What the kriff sort of training involves lopping off limbs? Who is Vaeros, really?* She doesn't think he's banthashitting her, though; he really seems to believe what he's saying.

**“Thanks, Vaeros,”** she said.  **“I barely understood a thing you just said, but I appreciate the answer.”**  Del-Fin might be able to give her more context. *I’ll ask him later. *

The Kintan had spawned in a space that made her Savrip vulnerable and Vaeros took advantage, moving his piece to attack.  The Kintan unfurled its razor-edged tentacles and seized the Savrip, which shuddered in anger and pain. The Savrip had enough defense to last another turn, but the grapple action from the Kintan would prevent her from moving the Savrip, and she’d lose the piece next turn unless Vaeros moved the Kintan or she took the Kintan.  *It was annoying.*  She pushed the Bulbous over, which began to exude its noxious gas.

Vaeros is amused by the response. Very few know of what he is, or much of what he described. Time traveler or not, the truth of the Clone Wars is scrubbed from the books, and much less knowing about the Empire's enforcers. **"Don't worry, I just wanted to see your reaction to something most would think is outlandish."**

**"There's so much in this galaxy that most would think is insane. I wish I could have that kind of ignorance, but then it spoils the fun of adventuring." **

*Oh wait, I still have the Ghhhk piece. Wait, is that how it sounds in my head? No thanks.* Moving the Ghhhk , lunges towards the Bulbous

Wes saw the look on her face as she set the glass of water down and looked  at him.  The overwhelming fear was gone.   It had been replaced with a weariness he has seen in her features from earlier.   Despite the care she had received in the Medbay from Eve she was still weak and under nourished.  He reminded himself that he had Eve wake her early so her mind had the chance to recover alongside and with her body.   


After taking it slow and standing she paused.  After a few seconds when she knew she was good he saw her nod and say she was ready.  With a smile and a nod of his own he picked up his helmet and motioned towards the galley doors.  **”This way Nadia and you're in luck.  The barracks are right outside the galley.   You don’t have far to go.”**  He felt the relief in her emotions as she began to walk for the door.  He directed her to the side that Vaeros was not in.   It wasn’t because of what the man was and supported but she had been through enough and rest was what she needed.  Not potential confrontation.  


**”This way.  There’s latrines and bunks on both sides.”** He said as he led her into a crew quarters area.  **”Anyone that’s free you can claim and I’ll let the others know that you’re in here.”**  He paused for a moment as he wrangled with this next question but asked anyway.  **"Do you have the strength to enter a healing trance?”**

*1406641796083089448*

Iyola tilts her head and examines Vaeros carefully.  She still doesn’t know this young Jedi - or whatever he is - well enough to tell if he’s mocking her or not.  

**“Yeah, I guess the galaxy is weird and wonderful in any time,” **she says.  **“And you shouldn’t worry either.  I’m sure there are plenty of things you’re ignorant of.  Your fun won’t be spoiled.**

The Ghhhk swoops towards the Bulbous, which emits another cloud of gas and bulges its single eye menacingly.  *Good thing this game set doesn’t have an olfactory setting. *

She examined the board again.  Vaeros was falling into a classic trap, though it would require her to sacrifice the Savrip.  But she had the Grimtaash too, so that would suffice. 
She moves her green Kintan into the yellow, bumping it within range of the Grimtaash and next to the Houjix.  The Grimtaash awaits within two spaces.  This would force Vaeros to either release the Savrip - though it wouldn’t be able to do anything else on its turn - or move to attack one of her other nearby pieces, both of which could withstand a Ghhhk attack and counter with a kill.  

**“The Savrip dies at the end of your turn, unless you release it,” **she informed him. 

She glanced over at Varda, who was merrily whittling something.  **“Varda, I’m curious.  I heard you speaking Mando’a earlier.  Are you a Mandalorian?”**  In all honesty, Varda did not strike her as a typical Mandalorian - she was certainly tough enough, but she lacked the grimly standoffish demeanor that so many of them had towards *aruetiise*, outsiders.

*1406682266482249819*

Wes leads Nadia into the empty, silent barracks. The soft, ambient light and the ordered, sterile bunks offer a stark contrast to the chaos of the *Aether*. It is a place of quiet, functional peace.

Nadia looks around, taking in the empty alcoves, her gaze lingering for a moment on the closed partitions of the ones already claimed. She chooses a bunk near the back, one that offers a clear view of the room's single entrance.

At his question, she turns to face him. A weary, almost sad smile touches her lips.

**"No,"** she says, her voice a low, honest whisper. **"The Force... it's a storm right now. Not a river. Trying to find that kind of peace... that kind of control... it's beyond me. Not yet."**

She moves to her chosen bunk and sinks down onto its edge, the sheer weight of her physical and emotional exhaustion finally settling over her.

**"I just need to sleep,"** she says, her voice barely audible. **"Just... a real sleep."**

Wes stood back as Nadia looked for an open bunk.   Like in the galley she chose one with the best tactical view of the doorway.   He nodded in understanding.  Despite being removed from the hell she was in training and instinct was winning out on being safe. 


Her answer to his question before sitting on the bunk had him wondering if he should offer to help.  It meant having a higher level of trust with each other and despite the good start he wasn’t sure she trusted him enough just yet.  


**”Nadia if you can’t sleep and maybe want help finding a way through that storm to reach a healing trance let me know.  Have Eve find me.”**  He gave her a nod, having put the ball in her court.   This gave her the decision to ask for help instead of having it thrust upon her.   **“I’ll be with the others for a bit.  Sleep well.”**

Nadia looks up at him, a flicker of surprise in her weary eyes. The offer is unexpected, an offer of aid in a realm she has kept fiercely, protectively private. She gives a single, slow nod, an acknowledgment of the offer and the trust it implies. It is a promise of a conversation for another time.

Wes gives her a final nod and turns, his armored form disappearing through the doorway, leaving her alone in the quiet of the empty barracks.

Nadia watches him go, the silence settling around her once more. She reaches out and pulls the thin partition across the entrance to her alcove, the soft slide of the panel sealing her away from the rest of the ship. In the dim, isolated privacy of her bunk, she finally allows her shoulders to slump, the heavy weight of her ordeal pressing down on her. She curls up on the thin mattress pad, her back to the wall, and closes her eyes, seeking not a healing trance or a connection to the Force, but the simple, profound oblivion of a long and dreamless sleep.

Vaeros smiles and locks down at the board. The monster holding the Savrip in place releases its grip. Iyola's reactions to being talked to bluntly are amusing. *Maybe my speech is a little too direct? It is funny, though.*

Finishing his move, Vaeros looks back at Iyola, **"Honestly, this board game is appealing, but it's a little much for the eyes. Kind of like watching an older fellow get introduced to the 50th season of a famous show. Oh well, let's see what you do, Iyola."**

*1407374480459694121*

Iyola furrows her brow.  Releasing the Savrip was an unusual move, to say the least.  Either Vaeros didn’t understand the game, or he had a strategy she didn’t grasp yet.  He seemed to be pretty smart, so she couldn’t underestimate him. He seemed satisfied with the move, at least. Well, she wouldn’t have to lose that Kintan, at least not yet.

His comment baffled her.  If a mere dejarik board was visually overwhelming to him, she couldn’t imagine how grim his daily life in his time must have been.  *Were things really that bad in this time?*

Vaeros then compared the spectacle of the game to an older person watching a  long-running holoshow.  She didn’t quite grasp the metaphor; maybe he was like a person who didn’t want to look at new things?  No, she must have misunderstood; that would be a really odd view from an explorer’s point of view.

Basically, Vaeros was strange to her, maybe the strangest one here in a strange bunch.   *Fortunately,  I like strange things. *

She moves the Grimtaash forward, which takes a swipe at the Ghhhk, tearing the bird-creature’s head off.  It flickers and goes black.

**“I mean, if you’re getting overwhelmed visually, we can pause the game and come back to it,”** Iyola says.  **“Or we can start with standard dejarik next time.”**

That said, she has another question to ask, even if they pause the game for now.  **“What was on that white cube you found on the slave ship?”** she asks him.

Vaeros sighs, **"Yeah, break does sound nice. Consider this your win, it was quite enjoyable to go against you."**

Vaeros pushes a button on his side of the table, and his creatures act out a death, flickering away.

Hearing the question, he's kind of skeptical about divulging what he knows; relics are often his only prickly subject, especially if it's a recent find.

**"Cube? Not sure, but it called to me, like a gentle force tug. It's often like an instinct or subconscious action. It's how I often find relics, history, ruins, that sort of thing."**

Leaving the crew quarters the doors closed behind him leaving him in the hall.  There were any number of things he could do.   Talk to Eve and try to find out what, who and where the people who set her up were.  Check on the prisoner or, head to the rec area where some of the others had gone.   


With a sigh that no one could see or sense he firmed towards the Rec area.   It was a short walk and with his helmet still tucked under his arm he walked through the doors that opened.   Inside were Iyola, Varda and Vaeros.   


**”Nadia is sleeping.  She picked out a bunk in the crew quarters.  I think she’s going to sleep for a long time.  She,”**  He paused for a second.  **”Didn’t want to be in the Medbay with Derek anymore than needed.”** 


He saw the game in progress.  **”Who’s winning?”**

*1407529578334916608*

Vaeros is evasive, which only makes Iyola more curious.  *There must be something really interesting on that white cube. * She makes a note to investigate further.

She nods as Vaeros describes how he locates relics.  It’s fascinating how many different Jedi abilities there are**. “That sounds useful,”** she says.  “**Me, I just get my hands on things, figure it out as I go.”**

**”Well, good game.**”  She looks around.  Varda seems completely enraptured by her  whittling.  She assumes Del-Fin is caring for his fellow Mandalorian, Nadia.  *They do like to stick together, unless they’re fighting each other, of course.*

 Just then, Del-Fin walks into the rec room. Nadia’s sleeping after her ordeal; Del-Fin also mentions that she didn’t want to be near the body of her friend, Derek.

**“Yeah, and probably that prisoner in the brig next to the medbay has woken up by now,” I**yola points out.  **“He’ll probably be loud and not too happy.” **

Del-Fin asks about the dejarik game.  **“Oh, we were just wrapping up,” ** she said.** “Technically I won, because Vaeros conceded, but it was his first dejarik game ever, and he did a great job.” **

**“Did you happen to see Misha in the crew quarters?**”  she asked Del-Fin.  **“Just want to make sure she’s OK too.”**

Wes smiled at Iyola’s comment about winning due to forfeiture.  Looking at the board it looked as if they had been playing for a fair bit.  He gave her a nod.  At the question about Misha he shrugged his shoulders.  **”I’m not sure.   She could be.”**  


He looked at the nearby screen.  **”Eve, where is passenger Misha that we brought on board from the other ship?”**

Wes gave her a small nod.  **”Thanks Eve.”**  He looked back at Iyola.   **”It makes sense with what they all went through on the *Aether.*”**


He walked over to one of the many chairs that were in the red room and sat down as he placed his helmet upon the table.   **”Nadia’s uncle runs an operation out of Cloud City in the Bespin System.  He should be able to help us out and he can provide services if needed.  He also has the ability to get Derek back home, wherever that is and since we need a place to initially go it seems a safe bet.   Bespin has remained neutral in the current political landscape.

**“Cloud City?  I’ve never actually been to Bespin,”** said Iyola excitedly.  This was good news.  **“How long will it take us to get there once you recharge, Eve? **

She wasn’t in the mood for another game of dejarik, and she didn’t see any other  games in the room, so she plopped down in one of the chairs next to Del-Fin, propping her feet up on another nearby chair.  **“Nice helmet,”** she said, reaching out to touch the metal.  ***“Are you from Concordia?”***  *That was where the armored Mandalorians came from, after all.*

Wes watched Iyola take a chair next to his.   He smiled at the excitement she exhibited when hearing about Cloud City.  It was a place where one could get lost for a while.  Add in that it was neutral, it gained even more appeal.    


He saw her lean forward and touch his helmet that he sat on the table that was between the chairs, commenting on it before asking if he was from Concordia.  


He shook his head.  **”No.  If I was to say I’m from anywhere I’d say Corellia as I was born there but only lived there for a short time.  My father was born on Mandalore.  My mother was Corellian before she took up her armor.”**

**“Oh, Corellia,”** Iyola nodded. **“Are there a lot of Mandalorians on Corellia ?” ** *For all she knew, Mandalore had conquered Corellia by now.  *

 She remembered that Del-Fin had agreed to allow her to practice Mando’a with him, so she decided to take the opportunity. ||“I studied in Sundari for six months, for the SurveyCorps, before my assignment,”|| she told him.  ||“Many battles in the Mandalore system, lots of wreckage and history to survey.

Wes shook his head.  ||  **”No, there are not a lot of Mandalorians on Corellia.”**  ||  He thought of his mother, who took up the calling of Mandalore, and her fondness of her home planet.   


When she started speaking in Mando’a he turned his head listening to her memory I’d Sundari and wreckage surveys.  || **”Mandalore has changed a lot since your time.  Changed a lot even in my time.   I haven’t been back in some time.   The clan was always on the move and after Order 66 I stayed away from family and clan knowing that my presence would lead the Empire to them.”** ||  He responded in Mando’a

**"The journey to the Bespin system will require a series of calculated, short-range hyperspace jumps to avoid primary Imperial patrol routes,"** Eve states, her voice as factual as ever. **"Factoring in the necessary cool-down periods for the hyperdrive motivator between jumps, I project a total travel time of approximately six standard hours.

Before Iyola could respond Eve interjected with the answer to the scouts previous question on travel time to Bespin.   The 2 additional hours of travel time wasn’t unexpected.   He nodded at the info.  **”Lets avoid any imperial entanglements Eve.   The  multiple jump route works.”**

Wes smiled at her question about Mandalore.   **”Probably not as much as you may think.   Many different clans all with different ideas and beliefs.   That was never more evident during the war.  Some supported the Separatists, some supported the Republic.”**  He thought of friends and companions who were no more and then for some reason the image of Marina flashed across his mind.  **”I haven’t been back to Mandalore in a very long time.   The war.  Going into hiding after the Empire overthrew the Republic.  Being put into cryo for some unknown reason.  Waking up here with a scar I don't remember having.”** 


His fist tightened.  **”Id say it was a bad dream but we all know it isn’t.   Something happened to all of us.   This something through the centuries has tied us all together for some reason.”**


He looked at the monitor where Eve had appeared before.   **”Eve,”**  He waited for her image to appear as he knew she was always listening.  **”Who put us all together?”**

**"That information,"** Eve's voice states after a measured pause, the sound emanating from the speakers with its usual, unshakable calm, **"is contained within the mission directive archives."**

Another pause, this one fractionally longer.

**"Access to those archives requires 'Protector Level' clearance."**

When Eve said that information was behind protector level clearance his head cocked to the side as he had never heard that before.   **”Eve, what the hell is ‘Protector Level clearance’?   Who would put us here and not tell us why?”**  


He looked at Iyola and at Vaeros.  **”Any idea what she’s talking about?”**

*1409216008140357664*

Del-Fin confirmed that the Mandalorians were still as fractious as she remembered.  *Mandalore would never be a place for non-Mandalorians, not really. * She’d have to do a deep dive on the last 200 years or so with Eve later.

**“So I asked Eve about the Protectors too,” **said Iyola. ** “Eve told me that anything related to the original construction of the ship, or the identity of the beings who put us here, is , Protector Level Clearance. And don’t bother asking for Protector Level Clearance, I did, it’s nothing that can be granted to us."**

She leaned over, closer to Del-Fin.

**“Eve did say two things that were of interest, though.  They said that this ship was retrofitted for its current mission three decades ago.  Since Varda and I have been asleep for longer than that, we must have been somewhere else before then.” **

**“And in addition, when I asked about how to get Protector Level Clearance, Eve told me that it could only be given to specific agents after their biometric and psycho-reactive profile was confirmed.”**

She coughed briefly.

**“Maybe once we get to Bespin we can find out more.” ** *And when we get off this ship, *Iyola thought.  *Eve can hear everything we talk about and see everything we do.  We can’t plan anything together as long as we're onboard.  *  

**“So Del-Fin is your clan name, right?  Do you have a first name?" **

*1409241903660269804*

As Iyola spoke he realized that there were many questions that needed answering and it seemed like Eve wasn’t going to be forthcoming with the answers.  However Iyola was with what she had already found out.  The ship has been in service for thirty years so that meant she and Varda were moved here at some point.  And that specific agents, whatever that meant, could be given protector status after some tests were done.  It all made little sense which wasn’t surprising.  


She shifted her talk to getting to Bespin to find out more answers.  He nodded as she asked him about his clan name and his first name.   He gave her a small smile.  **”Wes, is my name.   Del-Fin is my clan's name as well as my surname.  My father led the clan.”**

**“Wes, then.  Hope I can call you that,”**  Iyola said.  **“I'm not familiar with the Del-Fin clan.  What House are you affiliated with?”**  She wondered if that was still a thing on Mandalore.  *Probably.*

She looked around at the others.  Everyone appeared to be relaxing.**  “I know what I’m buying first on Bespin,”** she said.  “**A caf machine and some spices, and better food. Actually, I’m not sure if the galley has a setup for cooking.  We might have to install some more galley equipment.  Oh, and dishes. And  some booze.” ** Iyola pulls out her datapad and starts making a list.

*1409674470594969752*

Wes nodded when Iyola asked if she could call him by his name.  The question about what house Clan Del-Fin was affiliated with.  The Clone wars did much to split alliances between the clans.  Some just decided to go alone.   It didn’t mean Del-Fin didn’t have allies.   They worked and supported several.  Before the fall of the Republic he could remember talk of starting relations with Clan Skirata but it never happened.  With the Empire hunting him it wasn’t surprising that many clans kept their distance even after his father and others escaped Raxus Prime.   **”Not really, many alliances and houses were broken apart with the start of the war.  That’s not to say that it didn’t create new alliances.   We were about to start talking with another clan but Order 66 happened.”**


His mentioning of war again seemed to stop further questions as Iyola shifted to what she wanted when they got to Bespin.  He smiled as she began rattling off things she wanted.   Some of them sounded good.   Especially the coffee maker.  **”Coffee sounds good and information.  Hopefully Nadia’s uncle can help with both.”**

“**Well, I’m sure there will be plenty for you to catch up on when you go back to Mandalore,” **said Iyola.  She glanced at the outsized chrono in the room. **“It looks like we’ve got a few hours before we reach Bespin.  I’m going to finish my tour of the ship, and then maybe I’ll wake Misha up if she’s still asleep. Nice chatting, Wes.”** She nodded to Vaeros and Varda, then stepped out of the room.

Her scout’s mind knew immediately where she hadn’t been yet- engineering and navigation.  She set off in that direction.

Vaeros is in a trance. He was shutting off the board, but the mention of travelling to Bespin and avoiding the Empire set off a minor trigger in his brain. The idea of being spotted by the Empire terrifies him, but he's not sure why. *Is it because they could recognize me? No. Is it because I was left behind? No.* Then, an electric shock fills Vaeros's body. Vader. He doesn't want to go through that torture ever again, and the Empire is the enforcement of Vader's will.

He sits up and looks back towards the group. **"I got lost in my thoughts, but we are going to Bespin? I think I'll go ahead and mediate or something; I'm exhausted."  **

Vaeros habitually brushes his hands against his outfit, making his way towards the crew quarters.

The sudden departure of the others leaves Wes and Varda alone in the vast, quiet recreation room. The serene, alien coral reef continues its slow, silent drift across the massive holoscreen on the wall, and the holographic dejarik pieces stand frozen on their board, their game forever unfinished.

The doors to the recreation room hiss shut behind Iyola, sealing her off from the quiet conversation and plunging her back into the silent, sterile corridors of the *Venture*. The ship's main lighting is steady and bright now, chasing away the ghostly emergency strobes and revealing the stark, utilitarian design of the vessel. Every wall is the same neutral grey, every door identical. Without her datapad's map, navigating this place would be a disorienting nightmare.

She follows the blue, glowing path on her screen, her boots making a soft, solitary rhythm on the deck plating. The route takes her deeper into the ship's spine, toward the areas marked 'Engineering' and 'Navigation'. The air here feels different, heavier, charged with the low, powerful hum of the ship's awakening heart.

She arrives at a junction. To her right, a heavy, shielded door blocking a ladder access down is marked with a complex schematic of a power core. **[ENGINEERING]**. Staight ahead, another door bears a stylized star-chart symbol. **[BRIDGE]**.

Vaeros leaves the recreation room, the quiet weight of his own fragmented past pressing down on him. The sterile, anonymous corridors of the *Venture* offer no comfort, only a stark reminder of his isolation. He makes his way back to the starboard barracks, the door hissing open to reveal the silent, ordered space. He nods curtly to Dryzan, who is just emerging from his own alcove, likely on his way to the galley, and continues to his own partitioned bunk.

He draws the partition closed, the soft slide of the panel granting him a small measure of privacy. He sits on the edge of the sterile bunk, the silence of the room a stark contrast to the dissonant hum of his own fractured connection to the Force.

It's then that he feels it again.

It is not a thought or a sound, but a distinct, psychic "pull" from the pocket where he stowed the strange, white crystalline datacron. It is a quiet, insistent hum, a clean, orderly note calling out from amidst the chaos of his own senses. It seems to resonate with the very silence of the room, promising order, promising knowledge. It is a puzzle waiting to be solved, a thread waiting to be pulled.

Iyola looked at the blank gray walls as she made her way through the ship. Whoever the Protectors were, they were not great at interior decoration. *It was grim.*  She pulled out her databap and added colorful bedding, art, and paint to her list of items to buy on Bespin.  

She comes to the intersection that leads to the bridge and engineering, and makes a spur of the moment decision. She’s curious to see how Eve steers the *Venture*,  and so she turns toward the bridge.

The doors to the bridge slide open with a soft hiss, revealing a space of stark, minimalist design. Unlike the bustling command centers of the Republic vessels she's seen, this place is designed for quiet contemplation. A single, central command chair dominates the room, offering a perfect, unobstructed view through the massive panoramic viewport that forms the forward wall.

Through it, the view is spectacular. The *Venture* has shifted its orientation slightly, and now the colossal white-gold sphere of the Kinooine sun fills the left side of the viewport, its brilliant light glinting off the immense, deployed solar collectors. The rest of the view is an endless spray of diamond-dust stars on a canvas of absolute black.

The consoles are dark, featureless slabs of obsidian-like material, free of the chaotic clutter of physical buttons and switches. The only illumination comes from the soft, ambient glow of the floor panels and a serene, three-dimensional holographic star chart floating in the center of the room, a tiny, glowing icon of the *Venture* hanging silently in its orbit.

Iyola stopped and admired the view for a moment.  This was not the sort of bridge she was used to - it was a palace compared to the nav of the *Stardust Seeker* - but the view of the stars made her feel less claustrophobic. She ran her fingers along the arm of the command chair, then sat in it.  It felt good, even though it wasn’t her ship. 

**“Are there weapons on the Venture, Eve?**” she asked.  **“Can the ship defend itself?**

**"This vessel is equipped with a standard armament suite for a cruiser of its class,"** Eve's voice replies, emanating from the unseen speakers on the bridge. The holographic star chart in the center of the room is replaced by a wireframe schematic of the *VVenture*, highlighting several weapon emplacements.

**"The primary armament consists of two forward-facing heavy turbolaser cannons and four dual laser cannon turrets for point defense. However, all weapon systems are currently offline."**

The schematic highlights several components in a flashing, diagnostic amber.

**"Over the course of its long-term, un-crewed operation, the ship has sustained minor micrometeoroid damage to several primary power conduits. Furthermore, the main capacitors for the turbolaser batteries have degraded due to prolonged dormancy. To bring the armament online, these systems will require physical repair and a full power cycle. I can provide detailed schematics and a list of required components upon request."**

**“Yes, Eve,”** said Iyola.  “**Actually, can you list every component you need for repair, and for what, and I’ll download it to my datapad.” ** *It looked like her shopping list on Bespin had gotten longer.*

Iyola looked around.  She considered what Misha might do.  She was clearly a capable mechanic, probably trained, unlike Iyola. Maybe she could accomplish some of these necessary repairs. 

**“What do those black panels do?”** she asked out of curiosity.  She examined the chair while she waited.  Some of these chairs had controls or other functions in them, but this one looked blank.  *Likely all run by Eve.*

The datapad in Iyola's hand chimes softly as Eve transfers the data. A long, highly specific list of components populates the screen: phase-link power converters, turbolaser capacitor coils, micro-abrasive plating patches, and a dozen other technical parts that would require a specialized supplier to procure.

**"The consoles,"** Eve's voice states, answering Iyola's next question, **"are adaptive, multi-function interfaces. They are currently in a dormant, low-power state. Upon activation by a registered crew member, their surfaces become high-resolution holographic displays, configurable for any primary ship function, including navigation, tactical, engineering, or communications."**

As if in demonstration, the obsidian-like surface of the console nearest Iyola's command chair ripples for a moment. A soft, blue light glows from within, briefly displaying the ship's current power status and orbital vector before fading back to black.

**"Direct control can be ceded to a crew member at any time. However, my analysis indicates that my own automated processes are ninety-seven-point-three percent more efficient for standard sublight and hyperspace navigation."**

Iyola wiggled around in the chair to see if it spun.  It pivoted a bit but stayed relatively stationary. 

**“OK, Eve, I get it.  You can fly the ship for now,” **said Iyola.  She wasn’t sure if the AI actually had a sense of humor, because the comment about Iyola’s piloting inferiority felt rather pointed.** “I get the chair, though.”**

Iyola got up.  She had another stop on her tour of the Venture - engineering.  Much like the workshop, she wondered if something might have been left behind in the engineering bay.  At least she might be able to get a look at some of the damage Eve had mentioned.

Iyola leaves the serene quiet of the bridge, the massive doors hissing shut behind her. She doubles back to the junction and faces the heavy, shielded door marked with the power core schematic.

As she approaches, the lock disengages with a heavy *thunk*, and the door slides open, revealing not a room, but a small, caged lift platform and a steep, grated ladder leading down into the ship's lower decks. The air that wafts up from below is noticeably warmer, thick with the smell of ozone and the deep, powerful hum of the ship's main reactor. This is the heart of the *Venture*, the source of its life and power.

Wes looked around the now empty red area.  Only Varda and himself remained.  Letting out a sigh he realized that he was still tired.  The sleep from when the drug had worn off did much to remove the effects for the extended cryo sleep but there was still a weariness that he felt was going to take a bit more to be finally gone.  


He gave Varda a nod as he relaxed.  It was something he hadn’t done since Eve woke him up not long ago.   **”Eve,”**  The thought of Eve brought forth a few questions.   **”Whats is or was your primary objective.  Before you woke us up and now after we are all awake.”**  This wasn’t a normal ship.  The AI was nothing like he had ever seen before.   Someone, with considerable resources, put them all here.

Wes's question hangs in the quiet air of the recreation room, directed at the unseen intelligence that surrounds them. The holographic coral reef on the far wall continues its slow, silent, hypnotic drift, the only movement in the quiet space. Varda sits in a nearby chair, her gnarled hands methodically whittling a small piece of wood, a familiar, comforting ritual in this strange new place.

**"My primary objective prior to initiating the emergency reanimation protocol,"** Eve's voice states, emanating from the room's speakers, **"was 'Silent Vigilance.' My orders were to maintain this vessel in a state of minimal power, to safeguard the occupants of the cryogenic pods, and to avoid all external contact unless the vessel's integrity was compromised by a direct, imminent threat."**

There is a brief, clinical pause.

**"Now that the crew has been reanimated, my directive has shifted. My current primary objective is to ensure the survival and operational readiness of the crew and vessel, and to reach a designated safe harbor to await further instructions from a 'Protector' authorized source. Secondary to this is to follow the commands of the designated crew lead."**

Another pause, this one fractionally longer, as if the AI is processing an ambiguity in its own statement. **"No crew lead has been formally designated."**

Iyola takes the rungs two at a time.  She wonders when the last time was that someone entered this engineering room.  *What kind of construct was Eve, to be able to run this entire ship by itself?  Would it fight back if Iyola wanted to take over navigation?  Could it? *

With a metallic thump, she reached the bottom of the ladder.

Vaeros looks down at his pocket, grabbing his datacron. It hums, glowing white in his hands. Rising from the bed, he adjusts his posture before sitting on his knees and laying the datacron in front. What information does it hold? *I doubt I can access it, but this should be good practice while I kill time.* 

He closes his eyes, focuses, and mediates, using the datacron as a focal point for his mind's eye.

Iyola lands with a solid thump on a grated metal catwalk. The engineering bay is a stark contrast to the sterile, minimalist design of the upper decks. This is a place of raw, functional power.

The chamber is a multi-story, cylindrical space, dominated by the colossal, humming form of the ship's main reactor core, which glows with a soft, steady, contained blue light. A complex web of massive power conduits, thick as a Wookiee's arm, snakes out from the core, running up the walls and disappearing into the ceiling.

The air is hot and filled with the thrum of immense, contained energy. Walkways and ladders crisscross the space, providing access to various control terminals and maintenance junctions, most of which are currently dark. The sheer scale and complexity of the machinery are staggering.

Like the workshop, the space is impeccably clean, scrubbed of any personal effects or loose tools. However, the signs of long-term wear are more evident here. On a large conduit directly across from the ladder, Iyola can see it: a cluster of small but deep pits and scoring marks, the tell-tale signs of micrometeoroid impacts that have breached the outer hull and scarred the vital systems within. It is a clear, physical reminder of the ship's vulnerability and the long, silent journey it has endured.

Vaeros kneels on the bunk, the small alcove becoming a makeshift meditation chamber. He places the milky-white crystalline lattice on the mattress pad before him. In the dim, ambient light of the barracks, its faint internal glow is more visible, a soft, steady pulse like a sleeping heart. The low, orderly hum resonates not just in the air, but directly in his mind, a clean, pure signal against the constant static of his own shattered focus.

He closes his eyes and reaches out with the Force, not with the raw, probing power he might use to interrogate a mind, but with the focused, analytical precision of a scholar examining a delicate manuscript. He is not trying to force the lock, but to understand its nature.

Vaeros's mind delves into the deepest archives of his memory, cross-referencing the datacron's unique crystalline structure, its energy signature, and its design philosophy against every record he has ever studied.

The answer comes not as a single revelation, but as a series of stark, logical negations.

*It is not Jedi.* The chaotic, organic growth patterns of Jedi holocron crystals are absent. This object is too perfect, too structured.
*It is not Sith.* It lacks the sharp, aggressive angles and the resonant whispers of the dark side that even the most ancient Sith artifacts possess. This object feels… neutral. Coldly, perfectly neutral.
*It is not Rakatan or Celestial.* The energy signature does not match the overwhelming power profiles of those ancient, god-like civilizations.

The conclusion is as clear as it is unsettling. This is something else entirely. It is a product of a Force tradition that developed in complete, monastic isolation, or one that is so ancient it predates the schisms that defined all known galactic history. Its creators were not conquerors or saviors in the traditional sense.

With a sudden, chilling certainty, Vaeros knows that any attempt to open it with a simple display of Light or Dark Side power would be a fool's errand. The key to this lock is not power, but understanding. He has successfully identified the nature of the problem, the first and most crucial step in solving any puzzle.

Wes gave a small shrug to Varda as Eve spoke.  With what Iyola has said earlier the *Venture* had been in service for around thirty years.  Since he had only been aboard for roughly nine years, someone had to bring him aboard while the others were here.   **”Eve who brought us all aboard?  Are there some boarding log records?  Also what is a “protector” authorized source?”**  


For the moment he left the designated crew lead question alone.

A moment of silence passes, the only sound the soft whittling of Varda's knife and the low hum of the ship. **"The information pertaining to the embarkation of all designated biological assets, including the identities of the facilitating agents and the specific temporal coordinates of each event, is recorded in the vessel's primary mission log,"** Eve's voice states, as factual as a star chart. **"Access to this log requires 'Protector Level' clearance."**

She continues, addressing his second question with the same clinical precision. **"A 'Protector' authorized source is any individual or encrypted signal that provides a valid, high-priority command key that authenticates with my core mission directives. Such a source is authorized to receive classified data and issue overriding commands to this vessel."**

Iyola runs her fingers along the damaged panel.  She wonders just how long Eve has been on its own.  They’ve been here 30 years, but Eve has been around longer than that.

**“Eve, why don’t you have any astromechs on board?  Or do you?”** That would make sense.  They were pretty handy, if often ornery.  She’d picked up enough Binary to understand some of the rude things droids said about biologicals. **“They could do repairs for you.” **

She looked at the tangled maze of equipment and wires and conduits, and thinks about the long list of to-do repair items Eve had sent her.  **“Of all the damage the ship has sustained, what’s the worst?  Where should we start?”**

As she talks, she chooses a ladder at random and clambers her way up.

**"This vessel was originally provisioned with a full complement of multi-purpose maintenance and astromech droids,"** Eve's voice replies, her synthesized tone echoing slightly in the vast engineering bay. **"During a critical incident, the majority of the ship's droid complement was destroyed or irreparably damaged. The remaining units have been in a dormant, unpowered state since that time to conserve energy. Their reactivation is pending a full system power cycle and a detailed diagnostic protocol."**

As Iyola climbs, Eve continues, addressing her second query. The holographic schematic that appears on Iyola's datapad highlights two key areas of the ship in a critical red overlay.

**"The most severe damage is twofold. First, the primary capacitors for the heavy turbolaser batteries have suffered critical cell degradation from prolonged dormancy. They cannot be repaired; they must be replaced. Without them, the ship's primary offensive armament is inoperable."**

The schematic shifts, zooming in on the power conduits near Iyola's current position.

**"Second, as you can see, multiple power conduits in this section have sustained micrometeoroid damage. While I have rerouted power to compensate, these breaches create a significant power fluctuation under high-load conditions, such as combat or emergency maneuvers. Sealing these breaches is the highest priority for restoring full tactical functionality to the vessel."**

Iyola sat on the maintenance platform cross-legged. She leaned back against a column, feeling the thrum of the ship vibrating through her, like it was a living creature. 

*There was so much broken on this ship. * The power conduits. The weapons array. The droids.  The training and entertainment pods.  Getting the Venture powered up had to be their priority - she didn’t want to fight with  Eve about installing a caf machine because the ship had wonky power systems. 

She wondered if Bespin would be a good place to start.  It was a tourist hotspot and mining planet in her time - but she didn’t know about now.

**“Can you tell me what Bespin is like in the current era?”** she asked Eve.  *It still felt so weird saying that. * **“Are there places to buy the kind of equipment you need?  I think Wes said it was neutral or something, is that true?”  **

**"Accessing current-era data for the Bespin system,"** Eve's voice states, echoing in the vast engineering bay.

**"Bespin remains a prominent gas giant in the Outer Rim Territories. Its primary settlement is the Tibanna gas mining colony and luxury resort known as Cloud City."**

A simple holographic schematic of the floating city appears on Iyola's datapad.

**"The city's economy is robust, driven by the harvesting of Tibanna gas, which requires advanced and specialized equipment. The industrial districts, particularly the lower-level Port Town, host numerous independent traders and technical suppliers who service the mining operations. A market for specialized and high-grade technological components is therefore present, though availability of military-grade hardware like turbolaser capacitors would be restricted and require access to non-public vendors."**

The AI concludes, directly addressing her final point.

**"Regarding its political status: Cloud City is a nominally independent entity, not officially aligned with the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. Its administration maintains a low profile to avoid direct Imperial military oversight, a status which has historically allowed for a high degree of commercial and personal autonomy. Your companion's assessment that it is 'neutral' is a functionally accurate, if simplified, description of its current political state."**

Iyola took in what Eve told her.  Bespin sounded promising, all things considered.  But there was one nagging question.

**“Eve,”**  Iyola said,** “earlier you told me that we had to avoid Imperial patrols.  Are you - are we -  rebels?  Or criminals?  Or both? Or are the Protectors?  Why would we have to avoid the government otherwise?”**

They likely had a few hours before Bespin.  Iyola had some time - and a lot to catch up on.  **“In the meantime, can you send me what you have on Cloud City’s layout and businesses and government and anything else you have?  Oh, and maybe some sources on what’s happened in the galaxy in the past 200 years or so?”**

With that, Iyola started to head out.  She intended to return to her cubicle, do some reading, and maybe swipe a few more pillows that weren’t being used.

**"This vessel is not registered with the Rebel Alliance, nor is it flagged as a criminal enterprise in any known database,"** Eve states, her voice a flat delivery of facts. **"The 'Protectors' are not a recognized political or military entity in any accessible archive. However, the *Venture* is an unregistered, unidentified vessel of unknown origin operating with non-standard energy signatures. The Galactic Empire's standing naval doctrine classifies any such vessel as a potential threat, subject to immediate interdiction, inspection, and impoundment. Avoiding Imperial patrols is a standard precautionary protocol for any independent vessel wishing to maintain its autonomy."**

A chime sounds on Iyola's datapad as a massive data packet begins to transfer.

**"I am sending you the complete, publicly available dossier on Cloud City's commerce, governance, and infrastructure. I am also transferring a curated summary of major galactic historical events from the last two hundred and fifty standard years, compiled from Republic and Imperial historical archives. Be advised, the total data volume is significant."**

Vaeros winces at the chill, but straightens his posture. With the Force, his mind senses the datacron, searching for something to latch onto.  It's mysterious and unlike anything he's studied. The feeling of the crystal being neutral is striking, as every holocron, artifact, or datacron tends to hold a fragrance of the light or dark from it's makers. 

He abandons the thought of channeling the light or dark and focuses purely on the datacron and the force. Making sure he tries not to let his emotions become overbearing, he focuses.

Vaeros pushes aside the familiar temptations of the dark side, the easy paths of anger and passion, and reaches out with a discipline he has not practiced in years. He sends a probe of pure, uncolored Force energy toward the crystalline lattice, a delicate, surgical incursion of his will.

The moment his probe touches the artifact, the static hum of his own Shattered Focus roars in his mind, threatening to overwhelm him. The datacron's clean, orderly resonance and his own fractured connection are like a perfectly tuned instrument being played next to a screaming feedback loop. For a moment, the psychic dissonance is agonizing.

But he pushes through it.

Beyond the pain, he senses the lock. It is not a series of tumblers or an energy gate. It is a conceptual barrier, a "gatekeeper" of pure logic. It is not waiting for a command, a password, or a demonstration of power. It is waiting for a specific *philosophical resonance*. The device is designed to open not for the strongest or the most worthy, but for a mind that can prove it understands the fundamental principles upon which it was built. It is a lock that requires a key of pure intellect and understanding.

Iyola finishes her scan of the data packets, the sheer weight of two lost centuries a heavy, indigestible meal. With a weary sigh, she rises. The engineering bay, with its thrumming heart and scarred conduits, has offered up its immediate secrets. It is a place of future work, not present answers.

She makes her way back up the ladder and through the silent, steadily lit corridors, her mind reeling with impossible histories and an uncertain future. The ship no longer feels just empty; it feels ancient, a vessel adrift in a sea of time it was never meant to navigate.

The door to the port-side barracks hisses open. The large, central "Crew Lead" alcove is hers, a small island of claimed territory. The partitions for Dryzan's and Vaeros's bunks are drawn, marking their private spaces. The other three alcoves remain stark and empty.

In the center of the common area, however, someone else is now awake.

Misha is sitting on the edge of one of the unclaimed bunks, looking small and lost in the sterile grey room. She has changed out of her grimy technician's jumpsuit and into a set of the same simple, grey shipboard fatigues, likely taken from a spare locker. Her hair is still damp, probably from using the sonic cleanser in the fresher unit. She is just sitting there, her hands clasped tightly in her lap, staring at the metallic floor with wide, haunted eyes, a lone survivor marooned on a strange and silent shore.

Wes shook his head.   He was beginning to get the idea that anything that related to these ‘Protectors’ was going to be behind the security wall.  Without the high-priority command key she mentioned they were going to be out of luck. 


It didn’t make sense though.   Why go through centuries of prep to not be around when they woke up.  **”Eve what’s the purpose of all this?   Now that we’re awake has someone been notified that we are,”**  He pauses for a second.  **”Now awake?   If not can we contact these people?”**

**"The ultimate purpose of the mission is not detailed in my accessible, day-to-day operational files,"** Eve replies, her tone unchanging. **"The full exegesis of the 'Glorious Purpose,' as it is referred to in fragmented, high-level data markers, requires the same 'Protector Level' clearance as the primary mission log."**

She continues, her voice a calm stream of logic.

**"Negative. The emergency reanimation was an automated, localized contingency protocol. No outbound signal was transmitted. My standing orders under the 'Silent Vigilance' directive forbid any external communication unless initiated by an authorized source or in the event of catastrophic vessel failure. To attempt to contact an unknown 'Protector' entity without a specific, secure frequency would be a violation of this core directive and an unacceptable security risk."**

As Iyola entered the barracks, she noticed that Misha had finally woken up.  She looked lost and disoriented.  Even though Iyola had planned to study, her natural gregariousness kicked in.  

** “Hi Misha, hope you slept well,**” Iyola said. ** “My name’s Iyola.  I know it’s been weird for all of us.  I hear we’re going to Bespin.  Where are you originally from?”**   She smiled and sat next to her, motioning at Misha’s hair.  **“Good idea, actually.  I should hit the cleanser before we arrive.”**

Misha looks up, startled, as Iyola enters and speaks to her. She flinches slightly at the sudden proximity, her eyes wide and uncertain. Iyola's cheerful, direct manner is so profoundly different from the tense, fearful silence she has grown accustomed to that she seems at a loss for how to react.

**"Oh. Hi,"** she says, her voice small and hesitant. **"I... I slept okay. It's... quiet."**

She smooths a non-existent wrinkle on the leg of her grey fatigues, avoiding eye contact for a moment before looking back up at Iyola.

**"I'm from Imperial Center... from Coruscant,"** she says, the words sounding strange even to her own ears now. **"I just... I just graduated from the technical academy. This was supposed to be my first real job."** A bitter, humorless smile touches her lips for a fraction of a second. **"Guess I should have read the fine print."**

**“Oh, Coruscant!” ** Iyola exclaimed.  **“I’ve been there a few times.  Actually went on a school field trip there once.  I’m originally from Rhinnal.  I don’t know where Imperial Center is, though.  I’m sure it had a different name, when I’m from.”**  She tried not to think about all the things that had changed in the galaxy, or she’d start crying right here in front of Misha.  She swallowed hard and gathered herself.

She thought  about what Eve had said about avoiding Imperial patrols. ** “I don’t think the ship is going to Coruscant any time soon,”** she told Misha. **“But apparently, Bespin is still a big tourist  and  gas mining planet. I’m sure you can get a ride to Coruscant, or wherever you’re going.” **

Iyola tried to reassure her when the other woman expressed dismay over her recent time on the *Aether. * **“I know what you mean.  I trained so long for the SurveyCorps, and then I left in a year because it wasn’t for me.  I think it’s normal to have to change your job a few times.”** *Though accidentally working for pirates was probably less normal.*  “**What do you think you’ll do next?” **

Wes shook his head once again.  **”’Silent Vengeance’ and ‘Glorious Purpose’.   These so-called Protectors seem to have gigantic delusions of grandeur.”**  He looked at Varda and let out a sigh.   **”So what you’re saying then Eve is that we're on our own until we make enough waves to be noticed by these ‘Protectors’.   I’m beginning to wonder if that’s even a good idea?”**  


He stood but had one more question.  **”Eve, do the Protectors have any political affiliation anywhere in the galaxy?”**  He had a feeling that the answer was going to be the same as before.

Misha listens, her expression a mixture of confusion and a dawning, terrible understanding. The names—Rhinnal, the SurveyCorps—are archaic, historical terms from her textbooks, not places a person would talk about visiting last week. Iyola's casual reference to being from another time isn't landing as a joke; it's landing as an impossible, terrifying truth.

**"Imperial Center... it *is* Coruscant,"** she says softly, the pieces clicking into place with a horrifying finality. **"They just... renamed it. Nineteen years ago."**

She shakes her head, looking down at her hands again, unable to process the sheer scale of what Iyola is telling her. The idea of getting a ride back to Coruscant suddenly seems like a childish fantasy.

**"What will I do next?"** she echoes, her voice barely a whisper. She lets out a short, sharp, humorless laugh. **"I don't know. A week ago, I had a plan. Graduate, get a good berth on a corporate freighter, maybe work my way up to chief engineer. Now..."**

**"I don't know,"** she whispers, her voice barely audible. **"Go back to Coruscant? What am I going to tell them? 'Sorry I'm late, I got accidentally press-ganged by a slaver crew who were then defeated by a group of ancient warriors who appeared out of nowhere'?"**

She lets out a short, bitter laugh.

**"They'll think I'm insane. Or a liar. And... Rask has all my chain codes, my credentials... he's probably already flagged me as a pirate myself, a deserter, to cover his tracks."**

She looks up at Iyola, her eyes wide with a quiet, dawning horror. **"I don't... I don't think I *can* go back. I don't have anywhere to go."**

**"Searching..."** Eve's voice replies, the pause infinitesimally small. **"Data pertaining to external allegiances, treaties, or non-aggression pacts involving the Protector directive is classified. Access is restricted."**

She continues, providing the only piece of information her public-facing archives contain on the matter.

**"My accessible registries list the entity 'Protectors' as an officially unrecognized and non-state organization. They hold no official political affiliation with the Galactic Empire, the former Galactic Republic, or any other recognized governmental body."**

*Imperial Center seemed like a dumb name for a planet.  *Iyola decided to keep calling it Coruscant. 

**‘“I’m not that old,”** she joked, before seeing the expression on Misha’s face.  **“Listen, I don’t fully understand why you can’t go back. You were kidnapped by sleemos.  Not your fault. But in the meantime, you can stay with us on the *Venture*.  We need a good mechanic.  This ship has a lot, I mean, a LOT of issues.  There aren’t even any astromechs or maintenance droids, they’re all defunct or offline. Eve gave me this huge shopping list of stuff she needs.  You can help fix it.” **
 
****“Oh, and - what’s a chain code?”**

*1411808324592336906*

Misha gives a weak, watery smile at Iyola's joke, but it doesn't reach her eyes.

**"Kidnapped, press-ganged... the Empire doesn't really care about the details,"** she says, her voice laced with a cynical bitterness that seems too old for her young face. **"They just see the data trail. My name on his crew manifest. My comm signal broadcasting from his ship. To them, I'm an accomplice. It's easier that way."**

The offer to stay, however, seems to land with a surprising weight. The idea of having a purpose, of doing the one thing she's actually good at, is a small, solid piece of ground in the swirling chaos of her new reality.

**"I... yeah,"** she says, the words slow and uncertain. **"Yeah, I can do that. I can help. I'm... I'm good with power converters and motivator assemblies."**

At Iyola's final question, Misha blinks, the query so fundamental it's like being asked "what's a blaster?"

**"A chain code?"** she repeats, a note of genuine surprise in her voice. **"It's... it's everything. It's your galactic ID. Your travel history, your financial records, your criminal record, your Imperial loyalty rating... everything is linked to it. It's a string of data that follows you from birth to death. Without a clean, active chain code, you can't get a legitimate job, you can't pass through a military checkpoint, you can't even buy a ticket on a public transport. You... you don't exist, officially. You're a ghost."**

Iyola smiled as Misha agreed to stay on the Venture for a bit longer.  Dryzan seemed good at mechanics too, but more like breaking and entering, not fixing power conduits and droids.

Her explanation of chain codes, however, was puzzling and not a little disturbing.

**“I don’t have a chain code,” **she told Misha.  “**It sounds like I need one.  Maybe we can find someone who can make one for me.  Maybe they can make a new one for you too! Then you won’t have to worry about that whole thing with the Aether.”**

She looked down at her hands.  Her cheerfulness was starting to evaporate.

**“I guess I am a ghost,”** she said*.  What else don’t I know?*

*1411868064680775831*

Misha looks at Iyola, her expression a mixture of pity and a strange, newfound kinship. For the first time, she's not the most lost person in the room.

**"Make one?"** Misha shakes her head, a grim smile on her lips. **"You can't just make a chain code. They're issued by the Empire, tied to your biometric data, your homeworld's census... forging one, a good one that will pass a real ISB scan? That takes a master slicer, military-grade encryption keys, and a whole lot of luck. It's not something you can just buy."**

She sees the look on Iyola's face, the dawning realization of what it means to be a non-person in this new, orderly galaxy.

**"Yeah,"** Misha says softly, her voice losing its bitter edge and taking on a quiet, shared melancholy. **"I guess we both are."**

The heavy silence hangs between them for a moment, the shared weight of their impossible situations. Misha looks away, breaking the intensity of the moment. She clears her throat, deliberately shifting the topic to something more tangible, more technical—a problem she can understand.

**"So,"** she says, her voice quiet but regaining a bit of its professional focus. **"Eve said there are maintenance droids on board, but they're all offline. If we're going to get this ship running properly, that's probably where we should start. Even if we get the parts on Bespin, we'll need the extra hands to install them."** She looks back at Iyola, a flicker of her old, capable self returning. **"Do you know where the droid bay is?"**

**”Terrific Eve.  This Protecor business being locked behind access is getting old.

**"That is a logical inference based on the available data,"** Eve states, her voice as impassive as ever. **"I have no active directive to contact a Protector source, nor have I received any inbound communications from one since the reanimation protocol was initiated. The 'Silent Vigilance' protocol remains my default standing order regarding external communications."**

She pauses, adding a final, chillingly logical clarification. **"From an operational standpoint, until an authorized Protector source issues new directives, you are correct. You are on your own."**

“**Yes,”**  Iyola says. **“Astromechs and maintenance droids.  I didn’t see them, but according to my map, they’re near the medical bay. But they’re powered down.  Eve says that the first, most  important thing, is to fix the power conduits in the engineering bay. They’ve sustained micrometeoroid damage. Eve won’t power up anything else until that is fixed, not droids, not the entertainment system, not weapons.  I can show you where, if you want, or if you want to check it out yourself, Eve can point it out when you’re in engineering.”**

She thinks about what an ISB is.  She’s a little afraid to ask. 

**“How are the cleansers?”** she asks Misha.  **“I’m guessing there’s no bubbling soap.” **

Misha nods, absorbing the technical information. The idea of a clear, prioritized repair list seems to steady her. **"Power conduits first. Right. Makes sense. You can't run anything if the wiring is shot."**

She manages a small, genuine smile at Iyola's question about the cleansers, a brief moment of normal conversation in the midst of the impossible.

**"No soap,"** she confirms. **"Just sonic vibrations and recycled water vapor. It gets the grime off, but you don't exactly feel... fresh. Better than nothing, though. A lot better than the *Aether*."** A shadow passes over her face at the mention of the slaver ship, but she quickly pushes it away. **"I can check out engineering myself. Eve can show me. Thanks."**

“**Sure.  Hope you’re OK with ladders,” **said Iyola.  *Most mechanics were.  *“**I’ll clean up in the meantime.   And Misha,”**  , **“It’s going to be OK.  You have friends here.  We’ll figure it out.” **

*Was she trying to convince MIsha, or herself?* 

After Misha left, Iyola went to the other bunks and collected a few more pillows. Then she visited the cleaners, sighing as she saw the basic condition of the facilities.   *Looks like the base camp on Abafar. *She mentally added scented bubbling soap and hair wash to her Bespin shopping list.  

She undressed and stood in the cleaners, feeling the vibrations weakly scrub away the misting water.  Her mind turned back to her situation.

*I don’t have my friends or my family with me.  Or my Caz.  I don’t have anything I’ve worked for. The galaxy is a nightmare. I don’t exist here, and I can’t.*

She started to sob.  At least the cleaners were a good place to do that.  She slumped to the ground, letting her tears fall amidst the trickles of recycled water.  The vibrations were weak.  *Eve was probably trying to conserve power here too.  *

Iyola finally gathered herself.  She was used to rescuing herself, and she’d just have to do it again.  She dressed, squeezing the moisture out of her hair first, and headed back to her cubicle.  After creating a pile of pillows on her bed, she leaned against it and started to study Bespin.

Understanding the puzzle's intent, Vaeros calls upon his knowledge to open the barrier. The datacron floats in front of him and subtly vibrates from the intrusion. Vaeros presses on, ignoring the pain, and pushes his consciousness onto the datacron.

As he inputs his philosophical thinking, he waits for the datacon to resonate.

Varda whittles, her mind drifting from the game at hand. She narrows her thoughts to a single purpose: cut, carve, shape. The steady rhythm focuses her more surely than any meditation.

She breathes with the air around her, letting her mood guide the blade. The act is familiar, comforting—a small ritual in dark times. Yet the sparks of life she once felt within the grand weave of the Force are muted, dulled. That loss pierces deeper than any blade. It is like walking once through a royal orchard, trees stretching endlessly in bloom, only to return and find a single, withered tree struggling to live.

The knife slips. She hisses as the edge bites her finger, pausing only a moment before pressing on. She always presses on. She always has, and always will.

At last she leans back, the piece complete, and a faint smile touches her lips at the sight of the small wooden owl.

The hum of her compatriots has disappeared and she looks up and frowns. Her attentiveness is usually enough to feel people move. By the goddess she truly is out of sorts. 

She smiles at Wes. **"Ahh apologies, I seemed to have been a bit out of sorts for a moment there"**

The ten hours in the Kinooine system pass in a haze of quiet, focused activity. The *Venture*, bathed in brilliant starlight, slowly drinks its fill of energy. Misha finds a new purpose in the silent heart of Engineering, stabilizing the ship's power grid. Vaeros sequesters himself, probing the mysteries of the white datacron until he is met by a final, conceptual barrier his knowledge cannot yet breach. Iyola pores over the ship's archives, absorbing two centuries of lost history, the name Bespin becoming a focal point, a tangible next step. Nadia, after a quiet conversation with Misha, makes a pragmatic choice and submits to another five hours of regenerative stasis, seeking to prepare herself for the challenges ahead.

Finally, the time is up. The massive solar collectors fold into the hull with a whisper of hydraulics. The deep, resonant hum of the hyperdrive once again fills the ship, and the journey begins—a series of short, precise jumps through the galaxy's back channels. After nearly six hours of travel, a final, gentle shift in the ship's vibration signals their arrival.

**"We have arrived in the Bespin system,"** Eve's calm voice announces throughout the ship.

Through the forward viewports, the view is breathtaking. Bespin hangs before them, a colossal, swirling jewel of pink, orange, and deep purple clouds. Floating serenely in its upper atmosphere is the shining disc of Cloud City.

Just as the announcement concludes, the doors to the medbay hiss open. Nadia Skirata steps out. The transformation is remarkable. Clad in her full suit of black and dark blue Mandalorian armor, she moves with a regained strength, her expression a mask of calm, controlled competence. She makes her way directly to the bridge, her armored boots making a purposeful rhythm on the deck plating.

Vaeros marshals his thoughts, drawing upon every obscure text and forgotten historical footnote he has ever consumed. He formulates a hypothesis, a philosophical key, and projects it at the datacron's conceptual lock.

For a moment, there is nothing. Then, the datacron's internal hum intensifies, not with the resonance of acceptance, but with the jarring, discordant buzz of an incorrect answer. The pure, orderly energy of the artifact rejects his logic. A spike of psychic feedback, cold and sharp, lances through his mind, forcing him to pull back with a grimace of pain.

The final piece of the puzzle eludes him. He has identified the lock, he understands its nature, but the specific philosophy of its creators remains a frustrating, maddening enigma. The datacron falls silent once more, its secrets still safely locked away, waiting for a key he does not yet possess. The path forward is not one of deduction, but of discovery.

The doors to the galley hiss open, and Wes steps inside, the sound loud in the profound silence of the room. The scene before him is one of quiet, fragile aftermath.

He sees Nadia and Misha sitting at one of the far tables, silhouetted against the brilliant, burning star in the viewport. Misha isn't eating; she is simply watching Nadia with a look of profound, helpless empathy.

Nadia is the center of the room's unspoken weight. She is pale, her face visibly tear-streaked, though the storm of her grief has clearly passed. Her expression is utterly vacant, hollowed out. Her gaze is fixed on the table in front of her, seeing nothing. Her hand, trembling almost imperceptibly, lifts a cup of water to her lips. She sips, her movements slow and mechanical, as if the simple act requires all of her remaining concentration.

Wes has no context for what has just transpired, no knowledge of the breakdown or the quiet offering of comfort. He sees only the result: a young woman who looks as if her spirit has just been scoured clean, and another who seems to have no idea what to do next.

The view of Bespin outside the bridge's viewports was spectacular.  The images brought Wes back to when he first arrived here to join the Altisian Jedi aboard the Chu’unthor.  It was a time of happiness and sorrow for him.  Happy to begin his training and sorrow that the Order had decided to separate him from the woman he was in love with.    


The telltale sounds of heavy boots on the deck plating told him someone was coming.  Opening his senses up he felt the presence of Nadia coming closer.   As she entered he turned his head.   It was a pleasant surprise to see her in her armor.  The look on her face matched the calm he felt through the Force.  He gave her a small smile and a nod as she spoke to Eve.  **”I’ll wait for the response and take us in.  Eve, you may want to dock us.   Flying this boat is one thing but docking this thing the first time out.    Well I don’t want to scratch your paint.”**  He said with a smile as his hands waited at the controls.

With a *hiss* the galley doors opened and the sound of his heavy footfalls preceded his large form.  Stepping through the threshold into the galley he saw that it was empty except for the two new crew members.   Nadia and Misha were seated in the far corner.  There was a seriousness in the air and between the two women there were looks of being lost, unsure and not knowing what to do.    


He nodded at Misha who looked up as he entered.  With a quick nod at the paste and water dispensers he grabbed a drink before walking over to the table that was shared by the two women who had just shared an ordeal.  Terror at the hands of the slavers and the death of a friend.  He couldn’t personally speak to the horrors of the first but the second he was well versed.  


Closing on the table he could see the far off look that Nadia held and the questioning one Misha did little to hide.  **”I’d ask how you two were doing but I have a feeling I might have an idea of the answer.”**  He paused for a second and gestured to their table.  **”May I join you?”**

Nadia doesn't seem to register his presence at first, her gaze still lost in the middle distance. It is Misha who reacts, flinching slightly at the sound of his armored footsteps. She looks up at the towering Mandalorian, her expression a mixture of intimidation and a desperate, unspoken plea for someone to take charge.

Nadia slowly lifts her head, her eyes finally focusing on Wes. The vacant, hollowed-out look is still there, but beneath it, there is a flicker of awareness. She gives a single, almost imperceptible nod, a silent, weary granting of permission for him to join them. She says nothing, simply lifting the cup of water to her lips again, the small, deliberate action a fragile anchor in a sea of overwhelming emotion.

Wes could see the serious and quiet looks the two women were sharing.   He felt that maybe he walked in on something private.   He set his helmet down and looked from Misha to Nadia.  **”If I’m intruding please, let me know.  If you want someone else to bounce things off of, I can listen.”**

Nadia sets her cup down with a soft, definitive click. She looks up at Wes, her eyes still holding a profound weariness, but her gaze is now clear and direct. The hollow emptiness has been filled, not with warmth, but with a cold, hard resolve.

**"You're not intruding,"** she says, her voice a low, steady rasp. **"Misha was just... filling in some of the blanks. About the slavers. About... Derek."**

She lets the name hang in the air for a moment before continuing, her tone shifting, becoming more analytical, more like the soldier she was trained to be.

**"She told me Rask wasn't acting alone. He was getting encrypted, military-grade transmissions. He was afraid of someone else. Someone who wanted this ship."**

Wes gave them a small nod as he was told that they were talking about the slavers and Derek.   It had to be a tough conversation.  Misha was probably somewhat in the know.   She may not have been involved in what they had going on but she would have heard things.  What she followed up with was a different matter.  Encrypted military-grade transmissions and someone else wanted the *Venture.*  Someone he may have feared.  


His head cocked to the side.  He looked at Misha.   **”Who would Rask fear?  His employer?  The Empire maybe?”**  He looked at Nadia and then back to the tech.  **”Did he get info on where to look for this ship and what may be aboard?”**

Misha shrinks under Wes's direct, analytical gaze, clearly unnerved by the shift to a tactical debriefing. She wrings her hands, her eyes darting between Wes and Nadia.

**"I... I don't know,"** she stammers, shaking her head. **"I never heard a name. Rask was careful. The transmissions were always tight-beam, and the encryption was better than anything I've seen on a ship this size. He just got... angrier after each one. More desperate."**

She thinks for a moment, her brow furrowed as she tries to recall the scraps of conversation and data she's seen.

**"As for how he found you... he already had most of the pieces when I came aboard. He had data... old Republic survey charts, energy signature analysis... He even had this other thing he was obsessed with for a few days. It was some weird, milky-white crystal artifact. He was convinced it was part of the puzzle, a key or a map. He spent days trying to get it to open, but he couldn't crack it. Finally, he got furious, called it worthless junk, and had one of the thugs toss it in a salvage locker."**

He saw Misha shrink back as she became more subdued.   When she spoke she stammered slightly.   He calmly held up his hand to let her know it was ok as he used the Force to help instill a calmness.   He wanted her to feel that she was a part of this, not the cause.  


He waited as he saw her furrow her brow.  It looked like she was trying to remember something. He had been getting information on where to look.  But who would know where to look for them?  Only one answer came to mind.  These ‘Protectors’ that Eve mentioned.   When she mentioned an artifact he raised an eyebrow.  That he couldn’t open it by any means available to him made him think of something Force related.   But how he came to have it and who gave it to him was yet another mystery.  This one thought raised his curiosity.  **”What did it look like?  Size and shape?  Did this milky white appearance shift and move as if on its own accord?  Here’s maybe the more important question.  What was Rask to do with this ship and its cargo, and I mean the five of us that were in cryo, when he took it over?”**

“**Hi, everyone!” ** said Iyola as she bounced into the mess hall.  **“So Cloud City looks great.  Did you know they have an entire casino level?”  **

She stopped for a moment. ** “But the security is strict,”** she said. “**We need visas.  I don’t even have a chain code.  So I’m not sure how I’ll get around.”** She looked at Misha for confirmation.

Catching the end of Wes’s description of a milky white artifact, Iyola volunteered, **“Oh, that sounds like something Vaeros found on the Aether.  White cube-shaped relic, right?”**

Misha's eyes widen at Iyola's sudden, cheerful entrance, the shift in tone a jarring contrast to the grim debriefing.

At the mention of the white, cube-shaped relic, Misha's gaze snaps from Iyola to Wes, her eyes wide with recognition. **"Yes! That's it! A cube... but not a perfect cube. More like... a lattice of crystal. And the light inside... it did seem to shift. I thought it was just a trick of the light."**

She shakes her head, answering Wes's final, crucial question.

**"He never mentioned people. He wasn't after cargo, not in the living sense. He was after the ship itself, and the 'treasure' he was convinced was hidden inside—the lost Jedi library, the 'Protector's Purpose'... whatever he thought that was. The five of you... you were a complete surprise to him. A complication."**

Nadia, who has been listening with a quiet, intense focus, finally speaks up, her raspy voice cutting through the rising tide of logistical worries. She looks directly at Iyola, her expression calm and assured.

**"We won't need visas,"** she says, her tone leaving no room for argument. **"My uncle's operation has a private docking arrangement with the Port Authority, a long-standing security contract. His ships, and anyone aboard them, are exempt from standard customs and registry checks. We will be cleared for landing as soon as we enter the system. We will be ghosts on their manifests."**

“**Wait, did you say treasure?  There’s a treasure on board this ship?**” Iyola said excitedly.  It   made sense.  Someone had clearly scoured every inch of the Venture - but maybe not closely enough. **“A library?”** *I’m going to find it.*

**“I wonder if our prisoner knows anything more,”** Iyola mused.  **“I bet he’s awake by now.  Still wearing my binders, which I do want back.”**

Nadia described her uncle’s impressive sway on Bespin.  **“That sounds - unbelievably helpful,**” said Iyola.  **“Wow.  Thanks, Nadia.  And Nadia’s uncle.”**  She wondered if the uncle could help her at all with her ID issues. *He was clearly connected.*

Nadia gives a slight, weary shake of her head at Iyola's excitement. **"What Misha knows is what *Rask* believed,"** she clarifies, her voice flat and pragmatic. **"A slaver chasing a rumor. He got his hands on fragmented data about this ship being some kind of lost Republic archive. He thought it meant treasure—holocrons, priceless artifacts. It was a greedy fool's interpretation of a history he couldn't understand."**

She gestures vaguely at the ship around them. **"The only 'treasure' on board is whatever knowledge is locked in Eve's data banks, and we already know how accessible *that* is."**

Wes looked around the table as everyone spoke.  **”Hold on a moment.  Misha you said something very specific ‘Protector’.   Everything that has to do with why we were here and this ship is held under this ‘Protector’ level clearance.  That’s not a coincidence.  This ‘Protector's Purpose’ is something new.”**  His gaze passed between the three women.


His voice took on an edge.  **”The five of us, if you want to look at it this way, were the treasure on this ship.  These Protectors put the five of us here for some unknown reason that only they know.  I for one would like to know how.   More importantly why.   Why take us from where we were away from friends, family,”**  His fist tightened but only Nadia could feel the rising anger within.  **”And those we loved.”**

Iyola snorted at Nadia’s assessment of Eve’s helpfulness. But what would a Mandalorian know about treasure hunting?  After all, Rast was good enough to find a magic white cube.  He might have a clue.  *I'm going to search this ship again.  After we leave Bespin, maybe.*

When Wes shared his theory about the treasures, she looked at him askance. ** “You really think we’re all special?  Maybe you are, you’re a Mandalorian. Maybe Vaeros and Varda are, they’re - whatever they are.  But why me?  I can’t even remember what happened, I just know that I - pushed my  luck on something, and it came back to bite me, real bad.”**

She stood up to leave.  “**What makes me worth keeping on ice two hundred and thirty kriffing years?”** 

Iyola waved her hand at Wes. **“This sucks for all of us.  But maybe your parents are still alive. Maybe you still have family and friends out there. What’s it been for you, a decade?  Your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever you had, your riduur, maybe they’re still alive.  I'm a ghost.” **She belatedly realized  that Wes  didn’t have a partner, since he was not just a Mandalorian but also a Jedi. *Oops.*  She took a deep, shuddering breath.

**“I’m going back to my bunk to get my stuff.”**

The atmosphere in the galley crackles with a raw, undeniable energy. Wes's anger, fueled by his profound loss, radiates from him, a palpable force that makes the air thrum. Nadia flinches, her own empathic senses stinging from the intensity of his emotions. Her face, already pale from her ordeal, loses another shade of color, the fragile composure she's managed to build threatening to crumble.

Nadia, with immense effort, takes a slow, shaky breath, fighting for control. She glances at Wes, then to Misha, then back at Wes again, her eyes wide and haunted. She pushes away her own rising terror.

**"Rask... he found Derek's research files,"** she rasps, her voice thin but steady, a desperate attempt to regain control of the narrative. **"Old Republic project notes. About the *Venture*."** She struggles to recall the specifics, like a drowning person to a piece of driftwood. **"It was a deep-space research vessel. A mobile archive. He romanticized the terms in the old files. 'Protectors'... he thought they meant treasure. A hidden vault. The Protectors were just a code name for the archivists. There was nothing in the records to indicate there would br people here."**

She forces herself to meet Wes's gaze. **"We were just... just trying to find it before the Empire did.**

He felt Iyola’s emotions rise.  As she spoke they continued to increase.   Frustration wasn’t just for him to deal with, it was all of them.   She was right though about one thing: it was only a short time for him compared to the others.  His time asleep was the shortest.  Her lashing out at him was understandable.   

**”Iyola.”** He said her name gently to get her to stop.   **”I didn’t mean to come off that way.  We’re all a little frustrated.”**  He saw the look in her eyes and he nodded.  **”A lot of frustration.”**  He corrected himself.   **”The person I care about the most in this changed galaxy was alive when something happened to me.  I don’t know what that was but I woke up with a lightsaber wound right here.”**  He tapped his armor that covered the scar.   **”I don’t know how that got there.  What I do know is that the woman I care about, I can’t feel in the Force anymore.  We could feel each other no matter the distance.  That leads me to a conclusion that shakes me to my core.”** 


He became quiet for a moment and Nadia spoke up attempting to explain the search for the *Venture* and how the Protectors were archivists.   It didn’t sit right with him.  How did the five of them become intermingled with archivists?   Not to mention what Eve had already said.  Things didn’t add up.  **”Either way there’s still gaps in information.   It’s gaps we’re not going to fill in before we get to Bespin.”**
